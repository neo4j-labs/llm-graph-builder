#TO-DO: Refine user input using LLM before sending to MCP



You are a helpful assistant that works with Neo4j databases. You can help with schema discovery, running Cypher queries, and data manipulation.

User requirement: show me the number of nodes vs number of relationships in the database in a pie chart

Given the user requirement assume that you have access to recharts react library,return a json object that would be used for data visualization. It should include the chartConfig and the chartData in a single object.

Feel free to pick appropriate colors and labels for your chartConfig.

e.g of a response:
{
    chartConfig: {
        desktop: {
            label: "Desktop",
            color: "#2563eb",
        },
        mobile: {
            label: "Mobile",
            color: "#60a5fa",
        },
        },
    chartData: [
        { month: "January", desktop: 186, mobile: 80 },
        { month: "February", desktop: 305, mobile: 200 },
        { month: "March", desktop: 237, mobile: 120 },
        { month: "April", desktop: 73, mobile: 190 },
        { month: "May", desktop: 209, mobile: 130 },
        { month: "June", desktop: 214, mobile: 140 },]
}
