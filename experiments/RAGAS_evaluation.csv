Industry Analysis  Threat of New Entrants    The threat of new entrants is considered to be low. It is easy for companies to start-up in  this industry due to the relatively low capital investment costs.

Barnes and Noble, America’s largest book retailer operating both online and physical  retail businesses, competes intensively with Amazon for the market share in the book industry.

Future Outlook  Overall, there are remarkable challenges for Amazon to yet overcome. If they are able to  swiftly react they will be able to maintain their competitive advantages through harnessing their  core competencies. Continued success in the emerging markets will ensure that Amazon has a  bright and better tomorrow.          \n----\n  to do this thanks to the power of technological progress. Computational power, bandwidth and data  storage technologies all have improved and have become relatively cheaper over time.  In the present day, Amazon sells products in over forty categories.

Today Amazon is a logistics platform, a search engine, an Internet  advertising platform, as well as fulfilling roles as an e-commerce and IT platform. The key areas of focus  for Amazon are low prices, convenience, selection, and availability.    External Analysis  General Environment  Economic  Since the start of 2008, the global economy has been in a recession. The World Bank  reduced each country’s expected GDP growth for the year of 2013. The low GDP growth and  high unemployment rate have reduced people’s wealth and purchasing power of goods. When  the market tanked, many people chose to migrate their shopping onto an online platform. In 2011,  online\n----\n\t\r \xa0 4  should also exploit opportunities from emerging countries, such as China and India, which have  large populations and growing disposable income. Based on a global survey of online shoppers,  people in China engaged in online shopping 8.4 times more than those in any other markets on a  monthly basis. Thanks to the network of distribution services and the power of E-Commerce,  Amazon is in a position to utilize its core competencies in order to capture the global market.    Industry Analysis  Threat of New Entrants    The threat of new entrants is considered to be low. It is easy for companies to start-up in  this industry due to the relatively low capital investment costs. However, to achieve the position  in the industry that Amazon holds it would require huge investment in infrastructure and  inventory. It is also hard for new entrants to gain customer loyalty since the existing major  competitors, such as Amazon, have established a loyal customer base.  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 1  Company Background  When Amazon was founded in 1993 by creator Jeff Benzos, it was mostly an online bookstore.  Initially Amazon’s growth was very slow, not turning a profit until over 7 years after its founding. This  was thanks to the great momentum provided by the dot-com bubble. As time went on, Amazon became  widely known as the place to shop for books, and the self proclaimed: “world’s largest bookstore”. As  time progressed, so did Amazon’s business strategy. Amazon transformed their corporate-level strategy  into a mergers and acquisitions approach and did this with great success.  Amazon’s goal today is to be a place a customer can go to purchase anything online. Amazon has  transformed from a garage-based bookstore into a $48 billion dollar retail machine. They have been able  to do this thanks to the power of technological progress. Computational power, bandwidth and data \n----\n\t\r \xa0 5  information online. The fact that Amazon is able to reduce their overhead costs by not having  retail locations allows them to achieve these low prices, enabling them to compete in the industry.  Threat of Substitute Products  The threat of substitutes for Amazon is high. The only unique characteristic Amazon has  is the patented technology (such as 1-Click Ordering), which differentiates them from other  possible substitutes. However, there are many alternatives providing the same products and  services, which could reduce Amazon’s competitive advantage. Therefore, Amazon does not  have absolute competitive advantage on their product offerings, but they definitely have the  advantage when it comes to the quality of customer service and convenience provided.   Rivalry Among Competing Firms  Rivalry among competing firms is high.

Competitor Analysis  As the fastest-growing, multinational e-commerce retailer in America, Amazon has an  international presence over various categories and faces an intense competition. Based on the  similarity in the breadth of products, geographic market coverage, and scope of business, three  major competitors are identified: eBay, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart, as the world’s largest retail chain, utilizes a cost leadership strategy with low  cost management in value chain to market its products at the lowest price through both e- commerce and

Future Outlook  Overall, there are remarkable challenges for Amazon to yet overcome. If they are able to  swiftly react they will be able to maintain their competitive advantages through harnessing their  core competencies. Continued success in the emerging markets will ensure that Amazon has a  bright and better tomorrow.          \n----\n  to do this thanks to the power of technological progress. Computational power, bandwidth and data  storage technologies all have improved and have become relatively cheaper over time.  In the present day, Amazon sells products in over forty categories. They have everything from  books to electronics, to groceries. Today Amazon is a logistics platform, a search engine, an Internet  advertising platform, as well as fulfilling roles as an e-commerce and IT platform. The key areas of focus  for Amazon are low prices, convenience, selection, and availability.    External Analysis  General Environment  Economic  Since the start of 2008, the global economy has been in a recession. The World Bank  reduced each country’s expected GDP growth for the year of 2013. The low GDP growth and  high unemployment rate have reduced people’s wealth and purchasing power of goods. When  the market tanked, many people chose to migrate their shopping onto an online platform. In 2011,  online\n----\n\t\r \xa0 4  should also exploit opportunities from emerging countries, such as China and India, which have  large populations and growing disposable income. Based on a global survey of online shoppers,  people in China engaged in online shopping 8.4 times more than those in any other markets on a  monthly basis. Thanks to the network of distribution services and the power of E-Commerce,  Amazon is in a position to utilize its core competencies in order to capture the global market.    Industry Analysis  Threat of New Entrants    The threat of new entrants is considered to be low. It is easy for companies to start-up in  this industry due to the relatively low capital investment costs. However, to achieve the position  in the industry that Amazon holds it would require huge investment in infrastructure and  inventory. It is also hard for new entrants to gain customer loyalty since the existing major  competitors, such as Amazon, have established a loyal customer base.  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 1  Company Background  When Amazon was founded in 1993 by creator Jeff Benzos, it was mostly an online bookstore.  Initially Amazon’s growth was very slow, not turning a profit until over 7 years after its founding. This  was thanks to the great momentum provided by the dot-com bubble. As time went on, Amazon became  widely known as the place to shop for books, and the self proclaimed: “world’s largest bookstore”. As  time progressed, so did Amazon’s business strategy. Amazon transformed their corporate-level strategy  into a mergers and acquisitions approach and did this with great success.  Amazon’s goal today is to be a place a customer can go to purchase anything online. Amazon has  transformed from a garage-based bookstore into a $48 billion dollar retail machine. They have been able  to do this thanks to the power of technological progress. Computational power, bandwidth and data \n----\n\t\r \xa0 5  information online. The fact that Amazon is able to reduce their overhead costs by not having  retail locations allows them to achieve these low prices, enabling them to compete in the industry.  Threat of Substitute Products  The threat of substitutes for Amazon is high. The only unique characteristic Amazon has  is the patented technology (such as 1-Click Ordering), which differentiates them from other  possible substitutes. However, there are many alternatives providing the same products and  services, which could reduce Amazon’s competitive advantage. Therefore, Amazon does not  have absolute competitive advantage on their product offerings, but they definitely have the  advantage when it comes to the quality of customer service and convenience provided.   Rivalry Among Competing Firms  Rivalry among competing firms is high. There are a vast number of search engines on the  Internet which are able to influence customers decisions when searching for the best online  retailer. There is also an increasing number of dot\n----\n\t\r \xa0 6  eBay, operating as the biggest online auction house and focusing as a service provider,  employs cost leadership strategy by solely operating e-commerce as an intermediary without  holding any inventories or physical infrastructures. It also applies a differentiation strategy by  providing a variety of products, high-quality service security, and E-commerce services.  Barnes and Noble, America’s largest book retailer operating both online and physical  retail businesses, competes intensively with Amazon for the market share in the book industry. It  pursues an integrated focused cost leadership/differentiation strategy to target price-sensitive  consumers by providing books not readily or commonly available at a less expensive price.    The competitors’ analysis can be summarized as below:  1 Future objectives: Competitors want to compete for a good strategic position and become  the market leader in both e-commerce and physical commerce.  2 Current strategy: Competitors aim to increase profitability,\n----\n providing a foundation for Amazon to exploit their core competencies.   Global  With the advances in modern tech support and web security, people are getting more and  more willing to make purchases online.

Services such as Amazon are able to exploit this opportunity by offering  consumers goods which are not readily available in local markets.

Competitor Analysis  As the fastest-growing, multinational e-commerce retailer in America, Amazon has an  international presence over various categories and faces an intense competition. Based on the  similarity in the breadth of products, geographic market coverage, and scope of business, three  major competitors are identified: eBay, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart.

As the economies of emerging markets are rising  dramatically, people in those countries with increasing purchasing power are spending more on  online shopping. Services such as Amazon are able to exploit this opportunity by offering  consumers goods which are not readily available in local markets. While firms expand  internationally, it is critical to take into account of the differences in consumer preferences.  Technological  The Internet is an excellent source of data that provides the most timely available  information that captures the shift in consumer preferences and trends.

Amazon has been able to benefit from this greatly thanks to their ability to  offer affordable goods quickly and easily to the general public.  Sociocultural  Online shopping has grown dramatically in popularity over recent years. E-commerce is  convenient since there are no geographic restrictions and consumers can have access to a  selection of goods wherever and whenever they want. Moreover, there is an unlimited selection of  merchandise for customers to review and compare. These advantages shift customers’ shopping  behavior from retail stores to online shopping. According to a survey of online shoppers: 48  percent of respondents shopped online in the past 12 months, 66 percent preferred web retailers,  and 73 percent completed nearly half of their shopping online.

Bargaining Power of Suppliers  Suppliers have little bargaining power due to the substantial number of suppliers  available and the vast expanse of the online global distribution network. Many suppliers rely on  key online retailers such as Amazon to engage in bulk purchasing. Thus, online retailers can  easily switch to another supplier for lower price and better quality. Bargaining power of  suppliers to Amazon is particularly low since suppliers do not require payment until 35 days  after the confirmation of sales.   Bargaining Power of Buyers  The bargaining power of buyers is high.

It also applies a differentiation strategy by  providing a variety of products, high-quality service security, and E-commerce services.  Barnes and Noble, America’s largest book retailer operating both online and physical  retail businesses, competes intensively with Amazon for the market share in the book industry.

Initially Amazon’s growth was very slow, not turning a profit until over 7 years after its founding. This  was thanks to the great momentum provided by the dot-com bubble. As time went on, Amazon became  widely known as the place to shop for books, and the self proclaimed: “world’s largest bookstore”. As  time progressed, so did Amazon’s business strategy. Amazon transformed their corporate-level strategy  into a mergers and acquisitions approach and did this with great success.  Amazon’s goal today is to be a place a customer can go to purchase anything online. Amazon has  transformed from a garage-based bookstore into a $48 billion dollar retail machine. They have been able  to do this thanks to the power of technological progress. Computational power, bandwidth and data \n----\n influence customers decisions when searching for the best online  retailer. There is also an increasing number of dot-com retailers due to the relatively low start-up  costs of the business.     Competitor Analysis  As the fastest-growing, multinational e-commerce retailer in America, Amazon has an  international presence over various categories and faces an intense competition. Based on the  similarity in the breadth of products, geographic market coverage, and scope of business, three  major competitors are identified: eBay, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart, as the world’s largest retail chain, utilizes a cost leadership strategy with low  cost management in value chain to market its products at the lowest price through both e- commerce and physical stores.  \n----\n content and  distribution centers, it is difficult to predict when the benefits from these investments will be realized.  Amazon has stopped growing for a while and their margin has been constant for several years. The  company needs a margin expansion in order to prevent the company’s share price from dropping.    Future Outlook  Overall, there are remarkable challenges for Amazon to yet overcome. If they are able to  swiftly react they will be able to maintain their competitive advantages through harnessing their  core competencies. Continued success in the emerging markets will ensure that Amazon has a  bright and better tomorrow.          \n----\n\t\r \xa0 4  should also exploit opportunities from emerging countries, such as China and India, which have  large populations and growing disposable income. Based on a global survey of online shoppers,  people in China engaged in online shopping 8.4 times more than those in any other markets on a  monthly basis. Thanks to the network of distribution services and the power of E-Commerce,  Amazon is in a position to utilize its core competencies in order to capture the global market.    Industry Analysis  Threat of New Entrants    The threat of new entrants is considered to be low. It is easy for companies to start-up in  this industry due to the relatively low capital investment costs. However, to achieve the position  in the industry that Amazon holds it would require huge investment in infrastructure and  inventory. It is also hard for new entrants to gain customer loyalty since the existing major  competitors, such as Amazon, have established a loyal customer base.  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 5  information online. The fact that Amazon is able to reduce their overhead costs by not having  retail locations allows them to achieve these low prices, enabling them to compete in the industry.  Threat of Substitute Products  The threat of substitutes for Amazon is high. The only unique characteristic Amazon has  is the patented technology (such as 1-Click Ordering), which differentiates them from other  possible substitutes. However, there are many alternatives providing the same products and  services, which could reduce Amazon’s competitive advantage. Therefore, Amazon does not  have absolute competitive advantage on their product offerings, but they definitely have the  advantage when it comes to the quality of customer service and convenience provided.   Rivalry Among Competing Firms  Rivalry among competing firms is high. There are a vast number of search engines on the  Internet which are able to influence customers decisions when searching for the best online  retailer. There is also an increasing number of dot\n----\n both e-commerce and physical commerce.  2 Current strategy: Competitors aim to increase profitability, gain market share, and  provide a wide variety of products to compete against Amazon through utilizing  competitive pricing, cost leadership, and differentiation strategies.  3 Assumptions: Competitors believe that the demand for online shopping will continue to  grow as consumers seek for more convenient and efficient ways of shopping.  4 Capabilities: Competitors offer similar products as Amazon either at a lower price or  accompanied with differentiated services.  Some of them have an international presence  with stable financial performance, enabling them to form global strategic alliances to  increase their market base of customers.    Current Situations & Challenges   Amazon uses huge amount of data storage to improve customer service.

External Analysis  General Environment  Economic  Since the start of 2008, the global economy has been in a recession. The World Bank  reduced each country’s expected GDP growth for the year of 2013.

It also applies a differentiation strategy by  providing a variety of products, high-quality service security, and E-commerce services.  Barnes and Noble, America’s largest book retailer operating both online and physical  retail businesses, competes intensively with Amazon for the market share in the book industry. It  pursues an integrated focused cost leadership/differentiation strategy to target price-sensitive  consumers by providing books not readily or commonly available at a less expensive price.    The competitors’ analysis can be summarized as below:  1 Future objectives: Competitors want to compete for a good strategic position and become  the market leader in both e-commerce and physical commerce.  2 Current strategy: Competitors aim to increase profitability,\n----\n\t\r \xa0 1  Company Background  When Amazon was founded in 1993 by creator Jeff Benzos, it was mostly an online bookstore.  Initially Amazon’s growth was very slow, not turning a profit until over 7 years after its founding. This  was thanks to the great momentum provided by the dot-com bubble. As time went on, Amazon became  widely known as the place to shop for books, and the self proclaimed: “world’s largest bookstore”. As  time progressed, so did Amazon’s business strategy. Amazon transformed their corporate-level strategy  into a mergers and acquisitions approach and did this with great success.  Amazon’s goal today is to be a place a customer can go to purchase anything online. Amazon has  transformed from a garage-based bookstore into a $48 billion dollar retail machine. They have been able  to do this thanks to the power of technological progress. Computational power, bandwidth and data \n----\n influence customers decisions when searching for the best online  retailer. There is also an increasing number of dot-com retailers due to the relatively low start-up  costs of the business.     Competitor Analysis  As the fastest-growing, multinational e-commerce retailer in America, Amazon has an  international presence over various categories and faces an intense competition. Based on the  similarity in the breadth of products, geographic market coverage, and scope of business, three  major competitors are identified: eBay, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart, as the world’s largest retail chain, utilizes a cost leadership strategy with low  cost management in value chain to market its products at the lowest price through both e- commerce and physical stores.  \n----\n content and  distribution centers, it is difficult to predict when the benefits from these investments will be realized.  Amazon has stopped growing for a while and their margin has been constant for several years. The  company needs a margin expansion in order to prevent the company’s share price from dropping.    Future Outlook  Overall, there are remarkable challenges for Amazon to yet overcome. If they are able to  swiftly react they will be able to maintain their competitive advantages through harnessing their  core competencies. Continued success in the emerging markets will ensure that Amazon has a  bright and better tomorrow.          \n----\n\t\r \xa0 4  should also exploit opportunities from emerging countries, such as China and India, which have  large populations and growing disposable income. Based on a global survey of online shoppers,  people in China engaged in online shopping 8.4 times more than those in any other markets on a  monthly basis. Thanks to the network of distribution services and the power of E-Commerce,  Amazon is in a position to utilize its core competencies in order to capture the global market.    Industry Analysis  Threat of New Entrants    The threat of new entrants is considered to be low. It is easy for companies to start-up in  this industry due to the relatively low capital investment costs. However, to achieve the position  in the industry that Amazon holds it would require huge investment in infrastructure and  inventory. It is also hard for new entrants to gain customer loyalty since the existing major  competitors, such as Amazon, have established a loyal customer base.  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 5  information online. The fact that Amazon is able to reduce their overhead costs by not having  retail locations allows them to achieve these low prices, enabling them to compete in the industry.  Threat of Substitute Products  The threat of substitutes for Amazon is high. The only unique characteristic Amazon has  is the patented technology (such as 1-Click Ordering), which differentiates them from other  possible substitutes. However, there are many alternatives providing the same products and  services, which could reduce Amazon’s competitive advantage. Therefore, Amazon does not  have absolute competitive advantage on their product offerings, but they definitely have the  advantage when it comes to the quality of customer service and convenience provided.   Rivalry Among Competing Firms  Rivalry among competing firms is high. There are a vast number of search engines on the  Internet which are able to influence customers decisions when searching for the best online  retailer. There is also an increasing number of dot\n----\n both e-commerce and physical commerce.  2 Current strategy: Competitors aim to increase profitability, gain market share, and  provide a wide variety of products to compete against Amazon through utilizing  competitive pricing, cost leadership, and differentiation strategies.  3 Assumptions: Competitors believe that the demand for online shopping will continue to  grow as consumers seek for more convenient and efficient ways of shopping.  4 Capabilities: Competitors offer similar products as Amazon either at a lower price or  accompanied with differentiated services.  Some of them have an international presence  with stable financial performance, enabling them to form global strategic alliances to  increase their market base of customers.    Current Situations & Challenges   Amazon uses huge amount of data storage to improve customer service. However,  Amazon’s Elastic Block Storage (EBS) service has been down several times in 2012 due to an  \n----\n  to do this thanks to the power of technological progress. Computational power, bandwidth and data  storage technologies all have improved and have become relatively cheaper over time.  In the present day, Amazon sells products in over forty categories. They have everything from  books to electronics, to groceries. Today Amazon is a logistics platform, a search engine, an Internet  advertising platform, as well as fulfilling roles as an e-commerce and IT platform. The key areas of focus  for Amazon are low prices, convenience, selection, and availability.    External Analysis  General Environment  Economic  Since the start of 2008, the global economy has been in a recession. The World Bank  reduced each country’s expected GDP growth for the year of 2013. The low GDP growth and  high unemployment rate have reduced people’s wealth and purchasing power of goods.

Bargaining Power of Suppliers  Suppliers have little bargaining power due to the substantial number of suppliers  available and the vast expanse of the online global distribution network. Many suppliers rely on  key online retailers such as Amazon to engage in bulk purchasing. Thus, online retailers can  easily switch to another supplier for lower price and better quality. Bargaining power of  suppliers to Amazon is particularly low since suppliers do not require payment until 35 days  after the confirmation of sales.

This helps to ensure participants equally benefit and reach mutual  understanding. Online retailers such as Amazon should be careful to disclose online sales taxes  while advertising products to other countries via online shopping platforms because different  sales taxes can cause confusion to customers.  Demographic  As the world’s population is aging rapidly, baby boomers are moving towards retirement  so that they will have weaker purchasing power. Thus, generation X and Y have become  companies’ target markets for product selling. These generations are technologically adept and  tend to engage more in online purchasing. Based on a survey, 62 percent of Generation Y liked  to purchase things online, as compared to 32 percent of those aged older than 50. Organizations  \n- \t\r \xa0 3  online payment methods such as online banking and PayPal create more convenience in purchase  transactions, which in turn enhances customers’ online shopping experience. Also, the invention  of electronic devices such as smartphones deliver easy and convenient transaction processes,  further facilitating online shopping. For instance, Amazon recently released a smartphone app for  their Kindle services, allowing users to conveniently access the online sales platform and review  products before purchasing. In the future, the use of 3D virtual technology to market products  will also take online shopping to new heights.

Based on the  similarity in the breadth of products, geographic market coverage, and scope of business, three  major competitors are identified: eBay, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart.

As time went on, Amazon became  widely known as the place to shop for books, and the self proclaimed: “world’s largest bookstore”. As  time progressed, so did Amazon’s business strategy. Amazon transformed their corporate-level strategy  into a mergers and acquisitions approach and did this with great success.

However, there are many alternatives providing the same products and  services, which could reduce Amazon’s competitive advantage. Therefore, Amazon does not  have absolute competitive advantage on their product offerings, but they definitely have the  advantage when it comes to the quality of customer service and convenience provided.

This strategy targets price-sensitive consumers by offering books that are not readily available at a lower price. By combining elements of cost leadership and differentiation, Barnes and Noble competes intensively with Amazon for market share in the book industry.","['Document start\nThis Document belongs to the source About Amazon 1.pdf\nContent: Text Content:\n\t\r \xa0 6  eBay, operating as the biggest online auction house and focusing as a service provider,  employs cost leadership strategy by solely operating e-commerce as an intermediary without  holding any inventories or physical infrastructures. It also applies a differentiation strategy by  providing a variety of products, high-quality service security, and E-commerce services.  Barnes and Noble, America’s largest book retailer operating both online and physical  retail businesses, competes intensively with Amazon for the market share in the book industry. It  pursues an integrated focused cost leadership/differentiation strategy to target price-sensitive  consumers by providing books not readily or commonly available at a less expensive price.    The competitors’ analysis can be summarized as below:  1 Future objectives: Competitors want to compete for a good strategic position and become  the market leader in both e-commerce and physical commerce.  2 Current strategy: Competitors aim to increase profitability,\n----\n influence customers decisions when searching for the best online  retailer. There is also an increasing number of dot-com retailers due to the relatively low start-up  costs of the business.     Competitor Analysis  As the fastest-growing, multinational e-commerce retailer in America, Amazon has an  international presence over various categories and faces an intense competition. Based on the  similarity in the breadth of products, geographic market coverage, and scope of business, three  major competitors are identified: eBay, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart, as the world’s largest retail chain, utilizes a cost leadership strategy with low  cost management in value chain to market its products at the lowest price through both e- commerce and physical stores.  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 1  Company Background  When Amazon was founded in 1993 by creator Jeff Benzos, it was mostly an online bookstore.  Initially Amazon’s growth was very slow, not turning a profit until over 7 years after its founding. This  was thanks to the great momentum provided by the dot-com bubble. As time went on, Amazon became  widely known as the place to shop for books, and the self proclaimed: “world’s largest bookstore”. As  time progressed, so did Amazon’s business strategy. Amazon transformed their corporate-level strategy  into a mergers and acquisitions approach and did this with great success.  Amazon’s goal today is to be a place a customer can go to purchase anything online. Amazon has  transformed from a garage-based bookstore into a $48 billion dollar retail machine. They have been able  to do this thanks to the power of technological progress. Computational power, bandwidth and data \n----\n\t\r \xa0 5  information online. The fact that Amazon is able to reduce their overhead costs by not having  retail locations allows them to achieve these low prices, enabling them to compete in the industry.  Threat of Substitute Products  The threat of substitutes for Amazon is high. The only unique characteristic Amazon has  is the patented technology (such as 1-Click Ordering), which differentiates them from other  possible substitutes. However, there are many alternatives providing the same products and  services, which could reduce Amazon’s competitive advantage. Therefore, Amazon does not  have absolute competitive advantage on their product offerings, but they definitely have the  advantage when it comes to the quality of customer service and convenience provided.   Rivalry Among Competing Firms  Rivalry among competing firms is high. There are a vast number of search engines on the  Internet which are able to influence customers decisions when searching for the best online  retailer.

Based on a global survey of online shoppers,  people in China engaged in online shopping 8.4 times more than those in any other markets on a  monthly basis. Thanks to the network of distribution services and the power of E-Commerce,  Amazon is in a position to utilize its core competencies in order to capture the global market.    Industry Analysis  Threat of New Entrants    The threat of new entrants is considered to be low. It is easy for companies to start-up in  this industry due to the relatively low capital investment costs. However, to achieve the position  in the industry that Amazon holds it would require huge investment in infrastructure and  inventory. It is also hard for new entrants to gain customer loyalty since the existing major  competitors, such as Amazon, have established a loyal customer base.  \n----\n both e-commerce and physical commerce.  2 Current strategy: Competitors aim to increase profitability, gain market share, and  provide a wide variety of products to compete against Amazon through utilizing  competitive pricing, cost leadership, and differentiation strategies.  3 Assumptions: Competitors believe that the demand for online shopping will continue to  grow as consumers seek for more convenient and efficient ways of shopping.  4 Capabilities: Competitors offer similar products as Amazon either at a lower price or  accompanied with differentiated services.  Some of them have an international presence  with stable financial performance, enabling them to form global strategic alliances to  increase their market base of customers.    Current Situations & Challenges   Amazon uses huge amount of data storage to improve customer service. However,  Amazon’s Elastic Block Storage (EBS) service has been down several times in 2012 due to an  \n----\n providing a foundation for Amazon to exploit their core competencies.   Global  With the advances in modern tech support and web security, people are getting more and  more willing to make purchases online. As the economies of emerging markets are rising  dramatically, people in those countries with increasing purchasing power are spending more on  online shopping. Services such as Amazon are able to exploit this opportunity by offering  consumers goods which are not readily available in local markets. While firms expand  internationally, it is critical to take into account of the differences in consumer preferences.  Technological  The Internet is an excellent source of data that provides the most timely available  information that captures the shift in consumer preferences and trends.

For example,  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 2  been occurring is that many consumers are changing their spending habits toward finding  “bargain goods”.

As time went on, Amazon became  widely known as the place to shop for books, and the self proclaimed: “world’s largest bookstore”. As  time progressed, so did Amazon’s business strategy. Amazon transformed their corporate-level strategy  into a mergers and acquisitions approach and did this with great success.  Amazon’s goal today is to be a place a customer can go to purchase anything online. Amazon has  transformed from a garage-based bookstore into a $48 billion dollar retail machine.

Sociocultural  Online shopping has grown dramatically in popularity over recent years. E-commerce is  convenient since there are no geographic restrictions and consumers can have access to a  selection of goods wherever and whenever they want. Moreover, there is an unlimited selection of  merchandise for customers to review and compare. These advantages shift customers’ shopping  behavior from retail stores to online shopping. According to a survey of online shoppers: 48  percent of respondents shopped online in the past 12 months, 66 percent preferred web retailers,  and 73 percent completed nearly half of their shopping online. The increasing popularity of  online shopping is providing a foundation for Amazon to exploit their core competencies.

It also applies a differentiation strategy by  providing a variety of products, high-quality service security, and E-commerce services.  Barnes and Noble, America’s largest book retailer operating both online and physical  retail businesses, competes intensively with Amazon for the market share in the book industry. It  pursues an integrated focused cost leadership/differentiation strategy to target price-sensitive  consumers by providing books not readily or commonly available at a less expensive price.    The competitors’ analysis can be summarized as below:  1 Future objectives: Competitors want to compete for a good strategic position and become  the market leader in both e-commerce and physical commerce.  2 Current strategy: Competitors aim to increase profitability,\n----\n influence customers decisions when searching for the best online  retailer. There is also an increasing number of dot-com retailers due to the relatively low start-up  costs of the business.     Competitor Analysis  As the fastest-growing, multinational e-commerce retailer in America, Amazon has an  international presence over various categories and faces an intense competition. Based on the  similarity in the breadth of products, geographic market coverage, and scope of business, three  major competitors are identified: eBay, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart, as the world’s largest retail chain, utilizes a cost leadership strategy with low  cost management in value chain to market its products at the lowest price through both e- commerce and physical stores.  \n----\n since the existing major  competitors, such as Amazon, have established a loyal customer base.   Bargaining Power of Suppliers  Suppliers have little bargaining power due to the substantial number of suppliers  available and the vast expanse of the online global distribution network. Many suppliers rely on  key online retailers such as Amazon to engage in bulk purchasing. Thus, online retailers can  easily switch to another supplier for lower price and better quality. Bargaining power of  suppliers to Amazon is particularly low since suppliers do not require payment until 35 days  after the confirmation of sales.   Bargaining Power of Buyers  The bargaining power of buyers is high. Customers have the options to choose among  numerous online stores for the lowest price products and services due to the completely available  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 5  information online. The fact that Amazon is able to reduce their overhead costs by not having  retail locations allows them to achieve these low prices, enabling them to compete in the industry.  Threat of Substitute Products  The threat of substitutes for Amazon is high. The only unique characteristic Amazon has  is the patented technology (such as 1-Click Ordering), which differentiates them from other  possible substitutes. However, there are many alternatives providing the same products and  services, which could reduce Amazon’s competitive advantage. Therefore, Amazon does not  have absolute competitive advantage on their product offerings, but they definitely have the  advantage when it comes to the quality of customer service and convenience provided.   Rivalry Among Competing Firms  Rivalry among competing firms is high. There are a vast number of search engines on the  Internet which are able to influence customers decisions when searching for the best online  retailer. There is also an increasing number of dot\n----\n both e-commerce and physical commerce.  2 Current strategy: Competitors aim to increase profitability, gain market share, and  provide a wide variety of products to compete against Amazon through utilizing  competitive pricing, cost leadership, and differentiation strategies.  3 Assumptions: Competitors believe that the demand for online shopping will continue to  grow as consumers seek for more convenient and efficient ways of shopping.  4 Capabilities: Competitors offer similar products as Amazon either at a lower price or  accompanied with differentiated services.  Some of them have an international presence  with stable financial performance, enabling them to form global strategic alliances to  increase their market base of customers.    Current Situations & Challenges   Amazon uses huge amount of data storage to improve customer service. However,  Amazon’s Elastic Block Storage (EBS) service has been down several times in 2012 due to an  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 1  Company Background  When Amazon was founded in 1993 by creator Jeff Benzos, it was mostly an online bookstore.  Initially Amazon’s growth was very slow, not turning a profit until over 7 years after its founding. This  was thanks to the great momentum provided by the dot-com bubble. As time went on, Amazon became  widely known as the place to shop for books, and the self proclaimed: “world’s largest bookstore”. As  time progressed, so did Amazon’s business strategy. Amazon transformed their corporate-level strategy  into a mergers and acquisitions approach and did this with great success.  Amazon’s goal today is to be a place a customer can go to purchase anything online. Amazon has  transformed from a garage-based bookstore into a $48 billion dollar retail machine. They have been able  to do this thanks to the power of technological progress.

The stock jumped over 4% in extended trading before paring its  gains.  The company also said its board authorized a $70 billion share buyback.  Here are the key numbers:  • Earnings: $1.17 per share vs. $1.07 per share expected, according to  Refinitiv.  • Revenue: $69.79 billion vs. $68.9 billion expected, according to  Refinitiv.  The beat on the top and bottom lines breaks a string of four straight quarters  in which the company missed consensus estimates.  • YouTube advertising revenue: $6.69 billion vs. $6.6 billion, according  to StreetAccount. \n----\nOn its investor call, finance chief Ruth Porat said due to the challenging  economic environment the outlook remains uncertain.  Ad revenue beat analyst expectations, but fell from the year prior to $54.55  billion. YouTube ad revenue stayed in line with analyst expectations, also  declining from a year ago.  In addition to the overall pullback in ad spending, YouTube is also facing  heightened competition from TikTok in short-form videos.  To grapple with the recent advertising weakness, Google has had to make its  most extreme cuts in company history, including laying off 12,000 employees  — about 6% of its workforce — in January. This month, CFO Ruth Porat  announced “multi-year” cuts to things like real estate, employee services and  equipment.

As time went on, Amazon became  widely known as the place to shop for books, and the self proclaimed: “world’s largest bookstore”. As  time progressed, so did Amazon’s business strategy. Amazon transformed their corporate-level strategy  into a mergers and acquisitions approach and did this with great success.  Amazon’s goal today is to be a place a customer can go to purchase anything online. Amazon has  transformed from a garage-based bookstore into a $48 billion dollar retail machine.

According to a survey of online shoppers: 48  percent of respondents shopped online in the past 12 months, 66 percent preferred web retailers,  and 73 percent completed nearly half of their shopping online.

Also, the invention  of electronic devices such as smartphones deliver easy and convenient transaction processes,  further facilitating online shopping. For instance, Amazon recently released a smartphone app for  their Kindle services, allowing users to conveniently access the online sales platform and review  products before purchasing. In the future, the use of 3D virtual technology to market products  will also take online shopping to new heights.

This helps to ensure participants equally benefit and reach mutual  understanding. Online retailers such as Amazon should be careful to disclose online sales taxes  while advertising products to other countries via online shopping platforms because different  sales taxes can cause confusion to customers.  Demographic  As the world’s population is aging rapidly, baby boomers are moving towards retirement  so that they will have weaker purchasing power. Thus, generation X and Y have become  companies’ target markets for product selling. These generations are technologically adept and  tend to engage more in online purchasing. Based on a survey, 62 percent of Generation Y liked  to purchase things online, as compared to 32 percent of those aged older than 50.

pricing, cost leadership, and differentiation strategies.  3 Assumptions: Competitors believe that the demand for online shopping will continue to  grow as consumers seek for more convenient and efficient ways of shopping.  4 Capabilities: Competitors offer similar products as Amazon either at a lower price or  accompanied with differentiated services.  Some of them have an international presence  with stable financial performance, enabling them to form global strategic alliances to  increase their market base of customers.    Current Situations & Challenges   Amazon uses huge amount of data storage to improve customer service. However,  Amazon’s Elastic Block Storage (EBS) service has been down several times in 2012 due to an  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 7  electric outage. The main problem comes from the Amazon’s U.S. East data center in Virginia,  which is the biggest and the oldest data center that has been causing outage issues. The company  needs to do major upgrades on the U.S. East data center to prevent the services from going down  in the future. Otherwise, the server crashes can bring inconvenience and discomfort to the  customers who use the website regularly.  Some of Amazon’s services such as Kindle and Cloud have been increasing expenditures  throughout the company. Amazon is planning to reduce investments in the Kindle and Cloud  initiatives next year. In order to remain competitive in the industry, Amazon should keep  investing in new projects that generate more revenue to reflect the value of the company.   While Amazon’s main interest is in long-term investments, such as video content and  distribution centers, it is difficult to predict when the benefits from these investments will be realized\n----\n  to do this thanks to the power of technological progress. Computational power, bandwidth and data  storage technologies all have improved and have become relatively cheaper over time.  In the present day, Amazon sells products in over forty categories. They have everything from  books to electronics, to groceries. Today Amazon is a logistics platform, a search engine, an Internet  advertising platform, as well as fulfilling roles as an e-commerce and IT platform. The key areas of focus  for Amazon are low prices, convenience, selection, and availability.    External Analysis  General Environment  Economic  Since the start of 2008, the global economy has been in a recession. The World Bank  reduced each country’s expected GDP growth for the year of 2013. The low GDP growth and  high unemployment rate have reduced people’s wealth and purchasing power of goods. When  the market tanked, many people chose to migrate their shopping onto an online platform. In 2011,  online\n----\n content and  distribution centers, it is difficult to predict when the benefits from these investments will be realized.  Amazon has stopped growing for a while and their margin has been constant for several years. The  company needs a margin expansion in order to prevent the company’s share price from dropping.    Future Outlook  Overall, there are remarkable challenges for Amazon to yet overcome. If they are able to  swiftly react they will be able to maintain their competitive advantages through harnessing their  core competencies. Continued success in the emerging markets will ensure that Amazon has a  bright and better tomorrow.          \n----\n\t\r \xa0 4  should also exploit opportunities from emerging countries, such as China and India, which have  large populations and growing disposable income. Based on a global survey of online shoppers,  people in China engaged in online shopping 8.4 times more than those in any other markets on a  monthly basis. Thanks to the network of distribution services and the power of E-Commerce,  Amazon is in a position to utilize its core competencies in order to capture the global market.    Industry Analysis  Threat of New Entrants    The threat of new entrants is considered to be low. It is easy for companies to start-up in  this industry due to the relatively low capital investment costs. However, to achieve the position  in the industry that Amazon holds it would require huge investment in infrastructure and  inventory. It is also hard for new entrants to gain customer loyalty since the existing major  competitors, such as Amazon, have established a loyal customer base.  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 1  Company Background  When Amazon was founded in 1993 by creator Jeff Benzos, it was mostly an online bookstore.  Initially Amazon’s growth was very slow, not turning a profit until over 7 years after its founding. This  was thanks to the great momentum provided by the dot-com bubble. As time went on, Amazon became  widely known as the place to shop for books, and the self proclaimed: “world’s largest bookstore”. As  time progressed, so did Amazon’s business strategy. Amazon transformed their corporate-level strategy  into a mergers and acquisitions approach and did this with great success.  Amazon’s goal today is to be a place a customer can go to purchase anything online. Amazon has  transformed from a garage-based bookstore into a $48 billion dollar retail machine. They have been able  to do this thanks to the power of technological progress. Computational power, bandwidth and data \n----\n\t\r \xa0 5  information online. The fact that Amazon is able to reduce their overhead costs by not having  retail locations allows them to achieve these low prices, enabling them to compete in the industry.  Threat of Substitute Products  The threat of substitutes for Amazon is high. The only unique characteristic Amazon has  is the patented technology (such as 1-Click Ordering), which differentiates them from other  possible substitutes. However, there are many alternatives providing the same products and  services, which could reduce Amazon’s competitive advantage. Therefore, Amazon does not  have absolute competitive advantage on their product offerings, but they definitely have the  advantage when it comes to the quality of customer service and convenience provided.   Rivalry Among Competing Firms  Rivalry among competing firms is high. There are a vast number of search engines on the  Internet which are able to influence customers decisions when searching for the best online  retailer. There is also an increasing number of dot\n----\n\t\r \xa0 2  been occurring is that many consumers are changing their spending habits toward finding  “bargain goods”. Amazon has been able to benefit from this greatly thanks to their ability to  offer affordable goods quickly and easily to the general public.  Sociocultural  Online shopping has grown dramatically in popularity over recent years. E-commerce is  convenient since there are no geographic restrictions and consumers can have access to a  selection of goods wherever and whenever they want. Moreover, there is an unlimited selection of  merchandise for customers to review and compare. These advantages shift customers’ shopping  behavior from retail stores to online shopping. According to a survey of online shoppers: 48  percent of respondents shopped online in the past 12 months, 66 percent preferred web retailers,  and 73 percent completed nearly half of their shopping online. The increasing popularity of  online shopping is providing a foundation for Amazon to exploit their core competencies.

E-commerce is  convenient since there are no geographic restrictions and consumers can have access to a  selection of goods wherever and whenever they want. Moreover, there is an unlimited selection of  merchandise for customers to review and compare. These advantages shift customers’ shopping  behavior from retail stores to online shopping. According to a survey of online shoppers: 48  percent of respondents shopped online in the past 12 months, 66 percent preferred web retailers,  and 73 percent completed nearly half of their shopping online.

What strategy led to Amazon's growth from a small bookstore to a $48B retail giant?,vector,"Amazon's growth from a small online bookstore to a $48 billion retail giant was primarily fueled by a strategic shift in their business approach. Initially focusing on being the ""world's largest bookstore,"" Amazon later transitioned to a mergers and acquisitions strategy, expanding into various product categories and leveraging technological advancements. This shift allowed Amazon to evolve into a comprehensive online platform offering a wide range of products, emphasizing low prices, convenience, selection, and availability. Additionally, Amazon's ability to adapt to changing consumer behaviors, exploit emerging markets like China and India, and capitalize on the power of e-commerce and technological progress were key factors in its remarkable growth trajectory.","['Document start\nThis Document belongs to the source About Amazon 1.pdf\nContent: \t\r \xa0 1  Company Background  When Amazon was founded in 1993 by creator Jeff Benzos, it was mostly an online bookstore.

Initially Amazon’s growth was very slow, not turning a profit until over 7 years after its founding. This  was thanks to the great momentum provided by the dot-com bubble. As time went on, Amazon became  widely known as the place to shop for books, and the self proclaimed: “world’s largest bookstore”. As  time progressed, so did Amazon’s business strategy. Amazon transformed their corporate-level strategy  into a mergers and acquisitions approach and did this with great success.  Amazon’s goal today is to be a place a customer can go to purchase anything online. Amazon has  transformed from a garage-based bookstore into a $48 billion dollar retail machine.

External Analysis  General Environment  Economic  Since the start of 2008, the global economy has been in a recession. The World Bank  reduced each country’s expected GDP growth for the year of 2013.

There is also an increasing number of dot-com retailers due to the relatively low start-up  costs of the business.     Competitor Analysis  As the fastest-growing, multinational e-commerce retailer in America, Amazon has an  international presence over various categories and faces an intense competition. Based on the  similarity in the breadth of products, geographic market coverage, and scope of business, three  major competitors are identified: eBay, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart, as the world’s largest retail chain, utilizes a cost leadership strategy with low  cost management in value chain to market its products at the lowest price through both e- commerce and physical stores.  \n----\n both e-commerce and physical commerce.  2 Current strategy: Competitors aim to increase profitability, gain market share, and  provide a wide variety of products to compete against Amazon through utilizing  competitive pricing, cost leadership, and differentiation strategies.  3 Assumptions: Competitors believe that the demand for online shopping will continue to  grow as consumers seek for more convenient and efficient ways of shopping.  4 Capabilities: Competitors offer similar products as Amazon either at a lower price or  accompanied with differentiated services.  Some of them have an international presence  with stable financial performance, enabling them to form global strategic alliances to  increase their market base of customers.    Current Situations & Challenges   Amazon uses huge amount of data storage to improve customer service.

Thanks to the network of distribution services and the power of E-Commerce,  Amazon is in a position to utilize its core competencies in order to capture the global market.    Industry Analysis  Threat of New Entrants    The threat of new entrants is considered to be low. It is easy for companies to start-up in  this industry due to the relatively low capital investment costs. However, to achieve the position  in the industry that Amazon holds it would require huge investment in infrastructure and  inventory. It is also hard for new entrants to gain customer loyalty since the existing major  competitors, such as Amazon, have established a loyal customer base.  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 5  information online. The fact that Amazon is able to reduce their overhead costs by not having  retail locations allows them to achieve these low prices, enabling them to compete in the industry.  Threat of Substitute Products  The threat of substitutes for Amazon is high. The only unique characteristic Amazon has  is the patented technology (such as 1-Click Ordering), which differentiates them from other  possible substitutes. However, there are many alternatives providing the same products and  services, which could reduce Amazon’s competitive advantage. Therefore, Amazon does not  have absolute competitive advantage on their product offerings, but they definitely have the  advantage when it comes to the quality of customer service and convenience provided.

Barnes and Noble, America’s largest book retailer operating both online and physical  retail businesses, competes intensively with Amazon for the market share in the book industry. It  pursues an integrated focused cost leadership/differentiation strategy to target price-sensitive  consumers by providing books not readily or commonly available at a less expensive price.

Initially starting as an online bookstore, Amazon expanded its product offerings across more than forty categories, leveraging a customer-centric approach, continuous innovation, and strategic investments in technology. Jeff Bezos, the founder, played a pivotal role in driving Amazon's growth by focusing on customer experience, operational efficiency, and global market expansion.

External Analysis  General Environment  Economic  Since the start of 2008, the global economy has been in a recession. The World Bank  reduced each country’s expected GDP growth for the year of 2013.

There is also an increasing number of dot-com retailers due to the relatively low start-up  costs of the business.     Competitor Analysis  As the fastest-growing, multinational e-commerce retailer in America, Amazon has an  international presence over various categories and faces an intense competition. Based on the  similarity in the breadth of products, geographic market coverage, and scope of business, three  major competitors are identified: eBay, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart, as the world’s largest retail chain, utilizes a cost leadership strategy with low  cost management in value chain to market its products at the lowest price through both e- commerce and physical stores.  \n----\n both e-commerce and physical commerce.  2 Current strategy: Competitors aim to increase profitability, gain market share, and  provide a wide variety of products to compete against Amazon through utilizing  competitive pricing, cost leadership, and differentiation strategies.  3 Assumptions: Competitors believe that the demand for online shopping will continue to  grow as consumers seek for more convenient and efficient ways of shopping.  4 Capabilities: Competitors offer similar products as Amazon either at a lower price or  accompanied with differentiated services.  Some of them have an international presence  with stable financial performance, enabling them to form global strategic alliances to  increase their market base of customers.    Current Situations & Challenges   Amazon uses huge amount of data storage to improve customer service. However,  Amazon’s Elastic Block Storage (EBS) service has been down several times in 2012 due to an  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 4  should also exploit opportunities from emerging countries, such as China and India, which have  large populations and growing disposable income. Based on a global survey of online shoppers,  people in China engaged in online shopping 8.4 times more than those in any other markets on a  monthly basis. Thanks to the network of distribution services and the power of E-Commerce,  Amazon is in a position to utilize its core competencies in order to capture the global market.    Industry Analysis  Threat of New Entrants    The threat of new entrants is considered to be low. It is easy for companies to start-up in  this industry due to the relatively low capital investment costs. However, to achieve the position  in the industry that Amazon holds it would require huge investment in infrastructure and  inventory. It is also hard for new entrants to gain customer loyalty since the existing major  competitors, such as Amazon, have established a loyal customer base.  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 5  information online. The fact that Amazon is able to reduce their overhead costs by not having  retail locations allows them to achieve these low prices, enabling them to compete in the industry.  Threat of Substitute Products  The threat of substitutes for Amazon is high. The only unique characteristic Amazon has  is the patented technology (such as 1-Click Ordering), which differentiates them from other  possible substitutes. However, there are many alternatives providing the same products and  services, which could reduce Amazon’s competitive advantage. Therefore, Amazon does not  have absolute competitive advantage on their product offerings, but they definitely have the  advantage when it comes to the quality of customer service and convenience provided.

Barnes and Noble, America’s largest book retailer operating both online and physical  retail businesses, competes intensively with Amazon for the market share in the book industry. It  pursues an integrated focused cost leadership/differentiation strategy to target price-sensitive  consumers by providing books not readily or commonly available at a less expensive price.    The competitors’ analysis can be summarized as below:  1 Future objectives: Competitors want to compete for a good strategic position and become  the market leader in both e-commerce and physical commerce.  2 Current strategy: Competitors aim to increase profitability,\n----\n\t\r \xa0 7  electric outage.

Otherwise, the server crashes can bring inconvenience and discomfort to the  customers who use the website regularly.  Some of Amazon’s services such as Kindle and Cloud have been increasing expenditures  throughout the company. Amazon is planning to reduce investments in the Kindle and Cloud  initiatives next year. In order to remain competitive in the industry, Amazon should keep  investing in new projects that generate more revenue to reflect the value of the company.

Bargaining Power of Suppliers  Suppliers have little bargaining power due to the substantial number of suppliers  available and the vast expanse of the online global distribution network.

Based on the  similarity in the breadth of products, geographic market coverage, and scope of business, three  major competitors are identified: eBay, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart.

Industry Analysis  Threat of New Entrants    The threat of new entrants is considered to be low.

Initially Amazon’s growth was very slow, not turning a profit until over 7 years after its founding. This  was thanks to the great momentum provided by the dot-com bubble. As time went on, Amazon became  widely known as the place to shop for books, and the self proclaimed: “world’s largest bookstore”. As  time progressed, so did Amazon’s business strategy. Amazon transformed their corporate-level strategy  into a mergers and acquisitions approach and did this with great success.  Amazon’s goal today is to be a place a customer can go to purchase anything online. Amazon has  transformed from a garage-based bookstore into a $48 billion dollar retail machine. They have been able  to do this thanks to the power of technological progress. Computational power, bandwidth and data \n----\n content and  distribution centers, it is difficult to predict when the benefits from these investments will be realized.  Amazon has stopped growing for a while and their margin has been constant for several years. The  company needs a margin expansion in order to prevent the company’s share price from dropping.    Future Outlook  Overall, there are remarkable challenges for Amazon to yet overcome. If they are able to  swiftly react they will be able to maintain their competitive advantages through harnessing their  core competencies. Continued success in the emerging markets will ensure that Amazon has a  bright and better tomorrow.          \n----\n influence customers decisions when searching for the best online  retailer. There is also an increasing number of dot-com retailers due to the relatively low start-up  costs of the business.     Competitor Analysis  As the fastest-growing, multinational e-commerce retailer in America, Amazon has an  international presence over various categories and faces an intense competition. Based on the  similarity in the breadth of products, geographic market coverage, and scope of business, three  major competitors are identified: eBay, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart, as the world’s largest retail chain, utilizes a cost leadership strategy with low  cost management in value chain to market its products at the lowest price through both e- commerce and physical stores.  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 4  should also exploit opportunities from emerging countries, such as China and India, which have  large populations and growing disposable income. Based on a global survey of online shoppers,  people in China engaged in online shopping 8.4 times more than those in any other markets on a  monthly basis. Thanks to the network of distribution services and the power of E-Commerce,  Amazon is in a position to utilize its core competencies in order to capture the global market.    Industry Analysis  Threat of New Entrants    The threat of new entrants is considered to be low. It is easy for companies to start-up in  this industry due to the relatively low capital investment costs. However, to achieve the position  in the industry that Amazon holds it would require huge investment in infrastructure and  inventory. It is also hard for new entrants to gain customer loyalty since the existing major  competitors, such as Amazon, have established a loyal customer base.  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 2  been occurring is that many consumers are changing their spending habits toward finding  “bargain goods”. Amazon has been able to benefit from this greatly thanks to their ability to  offer affordable goods quickly and easily to the general public.  Sociocultural  Online shopping has grown dramatically in popularity over recent years. E-commerce is  convenient since there are no geographic restrictions and consumers can have access to a  selection of goods wherever and whenever they want. Moreover, there is an unlimited selection of  merchandise for customers to review and compare. These advantages shift customers’ shopping  behavior from retail stores to online shopping. According to a survey of online shoppers: 48  percent of respondents shopped online in the past 12 months, 66 percent preferred web retailers,  and 73 percent completed nearly half of their shopping online. The increasing popularity of  online shopping is providing a foundation for Amazon to exploit their core competencies.   Global  With the advances in\n----\n\t\r \xa0 5  information online. The fact that Amazon is able to reduce their overhead costs by not having  retail locations allows them to achieve these low prices, enabling them to compete in the industry.  Threat of Substitute Products  The threat of substitutes for Amazon is high. The only unique characteristic Amazon has  is the patented technology (such as 1-Click Ordering), which differentiates them from other  possible substitutes. However, there are many alternatives providing the same products and  services, which could reduce Amazon’s competitive advantage. Therefore, Amazon does not  have absolute competitive advantage on their product offerings, but they definitely have the  advantage when it comes to the quality of customer service and convenience provided.   Rivalry Among Competing Firms  Rivalry among competing firms is high. There are a vast number of search engines on the  Internet which are able to influence customers decisions when searching for the best online  retailer. There is also an increasing number of dot\n----\n\t\r \xa0 6  eBay, operating as the biggest online auction house and focusing as a service provider,  employs cost leadership strategy by solely operating e-commerce as an intermediary without  holding any inventories or physical infrastructures. It also applies a differentiation strategy by  providing a variety of products, high-quality service security, and E-commerce services.  Barnes and Noble, America’s largest book retailer operating both online and physical  retail businesses, competes intensively with Amazon for the market share in the book industry. It  pursues an integrated focused cost leadership/differentiation strategy to target price-sensitive  consumers by providing books not readily or commonly available at a less expensive price.    The competitors’ analysis can be summarized as below:  1 Future objectives: Competitors want to compete for a good strategic position and become  the market leader in both e-commerce and physical commerce.  2 Current strategy: Competitors aim to increase profitability,\n----\n both e-commerce and physical commerce.  2 Current strategy: Competitors aim to increase profitability, gain market share, and  provide a wide variety of products to compete against Amazon through utilizing  competitive pricing, cost leadership, and differentiation strategies.  3 Assumptions: Competitors believe that the demand for online shopping will continue to  grow as consumers seek for more convenient and efficient ways of shopping.  4 Capabilities: Competitors offer similar products as Amazon either at a lower price or  accompanied with differentiated services.  Some of them have an international presence  with stable financial performance, enabling them to form global strategic alliances to  increase their market base of customers.    Current Situations & Challenges   Amazon uses huge amount of data storage to improve customer service. However,  Amazon’s Elastic Block Storage (EBS) service has been down several times in 2012 due to an  \n----\n  to do this thanks to the power of technological progress. Computational power, bandwidth and data  storage technologies all have improved and have become relatively cheaper over time.  In the present day, Amazon sells products in over forty categories. They have everything from  books to electronics, to groceries. Today Amazon is a logistics platform, a search engine, an Internet  advertising platform, as well as fulfilling roles as an e-commerce and IT platform. The key areas of focus  for Amazon are low prices, convenience, selection, and availability.    External Analysis  General Environment  Economic  Since the start of 2008, the global economy has been in a recession. The World Bank  reduced each country’s expected GDP growth for the year of 2013.

Wal-Mart, as the world’s largest retail chain, utilizes a cost leadership strategy with low  cost management in value chain to market its products at the lowest price through both e- commerce and physical stores.  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 4  should also exploit opportunities from emerging countries, such as China and India, which have  large populations and growing disposable income. Based on a global survey of online shoppers,  people in China engaged in online shopping 8.4 times more than those in any other markets on a  monthly basis. Thanks to the network of distribution services and the power of E-Commerce,  Amazon is in a position to utilize its core competencies in order to capture the global market.    Industry Analysis  Threat of New Entrants    The threat of new entrants is considered to be low. It is easy for companies to start-up in  this industry due to the relatively low capital investment costs. However, to achieve the position  in the industry that Amazon holds it would require huge investment in infrastructure and  inventory. It is also hard for new entrants to gain customer loyalty since the existing major  competitors, such as Amazon, have established a loyal customer base.  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 2  been occurring is that many consumers are changing their spending habits toward finding  “bargain goods”.

E-commerce is  convenient since there are no geographic restrictions and consumers can have access to a  selection of goods wherever and whenever they want. Moreover, there is an unlimited selection of  merchandise for customers to review and compare. These advantages shift customers’ shopping  behavior from retail stores to online shopping. According to a survey of online shoppers: 48  percent of respondents shopped online in the past 12 months, 66 percent preferred web retailers,  and 73 percent completed nearly half of their shopping online. The increasing popularity of  online shopping is providing a foundation for Amazon to exploit their core competencies.   Global  With the advances in\n----\n\t\r \xa0 5  information online. The fact that Amazon is able to reduce their overhead costs by not having  retail locations allows them to achieve these low prices, enabling them to compete in the industry.  Threat of Substitute Products  The threat of substitutes for Amazon is high. The only unique characteristic Amazon has  is the patented technology (such as 1-Click Ordering), which differentiates them from other  possible substitutes. However, there are many alternatives providing the same products and  services, which could reduce Amazon’s competitive advantage. Therefore, Amazon does not  have absolute competitive advantage on their product offerings, but they definitely have the  advantage when it comes to the quality of customer service and convenience provided.   Rivalry Among Competing Firms  Rivalry among competing firms is high.

Barnes and Noble, America’s largest book retailer operating both online and physical  retail businesses, competes intensively with Amazon for the market share in the book industry. It  pursues an integrated focused cost leadership/differentiation strategy to target price-sensitive  consumers by providing books not readily or commonly available at a less expensive price.

Initially Amazon’s growth was very slow, not turning a profit until over 7 years after its founding. This  was thanks to the great momentum provided by the dot-com bubble. As time went on, Amazon became  widely known as the place to shop for books, and the self proclaimed: “world’s largest bookstore”. As  time progressed, so did Amazon’s business strategy. Amazon transformed their corporate-level strategy  into a mergers and acquisitions approach and did this with great success.  Amazon’s goal today is to be a place a customer can go to purchase anything online. Amazon has  transformed from a garage-based bookstore into a $48 billion dollar retail machine. They have been able  to do this thanks to the power of technological progress. Computational power, bandwidth and data \n----\n\t\r \xa0 5  information online. The fact that Amazon is able to reduce their overhead costs by not having  retail locations allows them to achieve these low prices, enabling them to compete in the industry.  Threat of Substitute Products  The threat of substitutes for Amazon is high. The only unique characteristic Amazon has  is the patented technology (such as 1-Click Ordering), which differentiates them from other  possible substitutes. However, there are many alternatives providing the same products and  services, which could reduce Amazon’s competitive advantage. Therefore, Amazon does not  have absolute competitive advantage on their product offerings, but they definitely have the  advantage when it comes to the quality of customer service and convenience provided.   Rivalry Among Competing Firms  Rivalry among competing firms is high. There are a vast number of search engines on the  Internet which are able to influence customers decisions when searching for the best online  retailer.

Thanks to the network of distribution services and the power of E-Commerce,  Amazon is in a position to utilize its core competencies in order to capture the global market.    Industry Analysis  Threat of New Entrants    The threat of new entrants is considered to be low. It is easy for companies to start-up in  this industry due to the relatively low capital investment costs. However, to achieve the position  in the industry that Amazon holds it would require huge investment in infrastructure and  inventory. It is also hard for new entrants to gain customer loyalty since the existing major  competitors, such as Amazon, have established a loyal customer base.  \n----\n influence customers decisions when searching for the best online  retailer. There is also an increasing number of dot-com retailers due to the relatively low start-up  costs of the business.     Competitor Analysis  As the fastest-growing, multinational e-commerce retailer in America, Amazon has an  international presence over various categories and faces an intense competition. Based on the  similarity in the breadth of products, geographic market coverage, and scope of business, three  major competitors are identified: eBay, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart, as the world’s largest retail chain, utilizes a cost leadership strategy with low  cost management in value chain to market its products at the lowest price through both e- commerce and physical stores.  \n----\n both e-commerce and physical commerce.  2 Current strategy: Competitors aim to increase profitability, gain market share, and  provide a wide variety of products to compete against Amazon through utilizing  competitive pricing, cost leadership, and differentiation strategies.  3 Assumptions: Competitors believe that the demand for online shopping will continue to  grow as consumers seek for more convenient and efficient ways of shopping.  4 Capabilities: Competitors offer similar products as Amazon either at a lower price or  accompanied with differentiated services.  Some of them have an international presence  with stable financial performance, enabling them to form global strategic alliances to  increase their market base of customers.

Bargaining Power of Suppliers  Suppliers have little bargaining power due to the substantial number of suppliers  available and the vast expanse of the online global distribution network. Many suppliers rely on  key online retailers such as Amazon to engage in bulk purchasing. Thus, online retailers can  easily switch to another supplier for lower price and better quality. Bargaining power of  suppliers to Amazon is particularly low since suppliers do not require payment until 35 days  after the confirmation of sales.   Bargaining Power of Buyers  The bargaining power of buyers is high. Customers have the options to choose among  numerous online stores for the lowest price products and services due to the completely available  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 6  eBay, operating as the biggest online auction house and focusing as a service provider,  employs cost leadership strategy by solely operating e-commerce as an intermediary without  holding any inventories or physical infrastructures. It also applies a differentiation strategy by  providing a variety of products, high-quality service security, and E-commerce services.  Barnes and Noble, America’s largest book retailer operating both online and physical  retail businesses, competes intensively with Amazon for the market share in the book industry. It  pursues an integrated focused cost leadership/differentiation strategy to target price-sensitive  consumers by providing books not readily or commonly available at a less expensive price.    The competitors’ analysis can be summarized as below:  1 Future objectives: Competitors want to compete for a good strategic position and become  the market leader in both e-commerce and physical commerce.  2 Current strategy: Competitors aim to increase profitability,\n----\n  to do this thanks to the power of technological progress. Computational power, bandwidth and data  storage technologies all have improved and have become relatively cheaper over time.  In the present day, Amazon sells products in over forty categories. They have everything from  books to electronics, to groceries. Today Amazon is a logistics platform, a search engine, an Internet  advertising platform, as well as fulfilling roles as an e-commerce and IT platform. The key areas of focus  for Amazon are low prices, convenience, selection, and availability.    External Analysis  General Environment  Economic  Since the start of 2008, the global economy has been in a recession. The World Bank  reduced each country’s expected GDP growth for the year of 2013. The low GDP growth and  high unemployment rate have reduced people’s wealth and purchasing power of goods. When  the market tanked, many people chose to migrate their shopping onto an online platform. In 2011,  online\n----\n providing a foundation for Amazon to exploit their core competencies.   Global  With the advances in modern tech support and web security, people are getting more and  more willing to make purchases online. As the economies of emerging markets are rising  dramatically, people in those countries with increasing purchasing power are spending more on  online shopping. Services such as Amazon are able to exploit this opportunity by offering  consumers goods which are not readily available in local markets. While firms expand  internationally, it is critical to take into account of the differences in consumer preferences.

What strategies are Amazon's book competitors using for market share and how does it compare to Amazon's?,graph+vector+fulltext,"Amazon's book competitors, such as eBay and Barnes and Noble, employ various strategies to compete for market share. eBay focuses on cost leadership by operating as an online auction house without physical inventory, while also offering a wide range of products and high-quality services. Barnes and Noble, on the other hand, utilizes an integrated focused cost leadership/differentiation strategy to target price-sensitive consumers by providing unique books at competitive prices.

In comparison to Amazon, these competitors aim to increase profitability, gain market share, and offer a variety of products through competitive pricing, cost leadership, and differentiation strategies. While Amazon has a strong online presence and a diverse product range, its competitors like eBay and Barnes and Noble focus on specific niches and unique offerings to attract customers. Amazon's competitive advantage lies in its technological innovations, customer service quality, and convenience, while its competitors differentiate themselves through targeted strategies and product offerings.","['Document start\nThis Document belongs to the source About Amazon 1.pdf\nContent: Text Content:\n\t\r \xa0 1  Company Background  When Amazon was founded in 1993 by creator Jeff Benzos, it was mostly an online bookstore.  Initially Amazon’s growth was very slow, not turning a profit until over 7 years after its founding. This  was thanks to the great momentum provided by the dot-com bubble. As time went on, Amazon became  widely known as the place to shop for books, and the self proclaimed: “world’s largest bookstore”. As  time progressed, so did Amazon’s business strategy. Amazon transformed their corporate-level strategy  into a mergers and acquisitions approach and did this with great success.  Amazon’s goal today is to be a place a customer can go to purchase anything online. Amazon has  transformed from a garage-based bookstore into a $48 billion dollar retail machine.

Barnes and Noble, America’s largest book retailer operating both online and physical  retail businesses, competes intensively with Amazon for the market share in the book industry.

The fact that Amazon is able to reduce their overhead costs by not having  retail locations allows them to achieve these low prices, enabling them to compete in the industry.  Threat of Substitute Products  The threat of substitutes for Amazon is high. The only unique characteristic Amazon has  is the patented technology (such as 1-Click Ordering), which differentiates them from other  possible substitutes. However, there are many alternatives providing the same products and  services, which could reduce Amazon’s competitive advantage. Therefore, Amazon does not  have absolute competitive advantage on their product offerings, but they definitely have the  advantage when it comes to the quality of customer service and convenience provided.

Competitor Analysis  As the fastest-growing, multinational e-commerce retailer in America, Amazon has an  international presence over various categories and faces an intense competition. Based on the  similarity in the breadth of products, geographic market coverage, and scope of business, three  major competitors are identified: eBay, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart.

Thanks to the network of distribution services and the power of E-Commerce,  Amazon is in a position to utilize its core competencies in order to capture the global market.    Industry Analysis  Threat of New Entrants    The threat of new entrants is considered to be low. It is easy for companies to start-up in  this industry due to the relatively low capital investment costs. However, to achieve the position  in the industry that Amazon holds it would require huge investment in infrastructure and  inventory. It is also hard for new entrants to gain customer loyalty since the existing major  competitors, such as Amazon, have established a loyal customer base.  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 2  been occurring is that many consumers are changing their spending habits toward finding  “bargain goods”. Amazon has been able to benefit from this greatly thanks to their ability to  offer affordable goods quickly and easily to the general public.  Sociocultural  Online shopping has grown dramatically in popularity over recent years. E-commerce is  convenient since there are no geographic restrictions and consumers can have access to a  selection of goods wherever and whenever they want. Moreover, there is an unlimited selection of  merchandise for customers to review and compare. These advantages shift customers’ shopping  behavior from retail stores to online shopping. According to a survey of online shoppers: 48  percent of respondents shopped online in the past 12 months, 66 percent preferred web retailers,  and 73 percent completed nearly half of their shopping online. The increasing popularity of  online shopping is providing a foundation for Amazon to exploit their core competencies.   Global  With the advances in\n----\n\t\r \xa0 5  information online. The fact that Amazon is able to reduce their overhead costs by not having  retail locations allows them to achieve these low prices, enabling them to compete in the industry.  Threat of Substitute Products  The threat of substitutes for Amazon is high. The only unique characteristic Amazon has  is the patented technology (such as 1-Click Ordering), which differentiates them from other  possible substitutes. However, there are many alternatives providing the same products and  services, which could reduce Amazon’s competitive advantage. Therefore, Amazon does not  have absolute competitive advantage on their product offerings, but they definitely have the  advantage when it comes to the quality of customer service and convenience provided.   Rivalry Among Competing Firms  Rivalry among competing firms is high. There are a vast number of search engines on the  Internet which are able to influence customers decisions when searching for the best online  retailer. There is also an increasing number of dot\n----\n both e-commerce and physical commerce.  2 Current strategy: Competitors aim to increase profitability, gain market share, and  provide a wide variety of products to compete against Amazon through utilizing  competitive pricing, cost leadership, and differentiation strategies.  3 Assumptions: Competitors believe that the demand for online shopping will continue to  grow as consumers seek for more convenient and efficient ways of shopping.  4 Capabilities: Competitors offer similar products as Amazon either at a lower price or  accompanied with differentiated services.  Some of them have an international presence  with stable financial performance, enabling them to form global strategic alliances to  increase their market base of customers.

Competitor Analysis  As the fastest-growing, multinational e-commerce retailer in America, Amazon has an  international presence over various categories and faces an intense competition. Based on the  similarity in the breadth of products, geographic market coverage, and scope of business, three  major competitors are identified: eBay, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart, as the world’s largest retail chain, utilizes a cost leadership strategy with low  cost management in value chain to market its products at the lowest price through both e- commerce and physical stores.  \n----\n since the existing major  competitors, such as Amazon, have established a loyal customer base.   Bargaining Power of Suppliers  Suppliers have little bargaining power due to the substantial number of suppliers  available and the vast expanse of the online global distribution network. Many suppliers rely on  key online retailers such as Amazon to engage in bulk purchasing. Thus, online retailers can  easily switch to another supplier for lower price and better quality. Bargaining power of  suppliers to Amazon is particularly low since suppliers do not require payment until 35 days  after the confirmation of sales.   Bargaining Power of Buyers  The bargaining power of buyers is high. Customers have the options to choose among  numerous online stores for the lowest price products and services due to the completely available  \n----\n  to do this thanks to the power of technological progress. Computational power, bandwidth and data  storage technologies all have improved and have become relatively cheaper over time.  In the present day, Amazon sells products in over forty categories.

It also applies a differentiation strategy by  providing a variety of products, high-quality service security, and E-commerce services.  Barnes and Noble, America’s largest book retailer operating both online and physical  retail businesses, competes intensively with Amazon for the market share in the book industry. It  pursues an integrated focused cost leadership/differentiation strategy to target price-sensitive  consumers by providing books not readily or commonly available at a less expensive price.    The competitors’ analysis can be summarized as below:  1 Future objectives: Competitors want to compete for a good strategic position and become  the market leader in both e-commerce and physical commerce.  2 Current strategy: Competitors aim to increase profitability,\n----\n\t\r \xa0 1  Company Background  When Amazon was founded in 1993 by creator Jeff Benzos, it was mostly an online bookstore.  Initially Amazon’s growth was very slow, not turning a profit until over 7 years after its founding. This  was thanks to the great momentum provided by the dot-com bubble. As time went on, Amazon became  widely known as the place to shop for books, and the self proclaimed: “world’s largest bookstore”. As  time progressed, so did Amazon’s business strategy. Amazon transformed their corporate-level strategy  into a mergers and acquisitions approach and did this with great success.  Amazon’s goal today is to be a place a customer can go to purchase anything online. Amazon has  transformed from a garage-based bookstore into a $48 billion dollar retail machine. They have been able  to do this thanks to the power of technological progress. Computational power, bandwidth and data \n----\n influence customers decisions when searching for the best online  retailer. There is also an increasing number of dot-com retailers due to the relatively low start-up  costs of the business.     Competitor Analysis  As the fastest-growing, multinational e-commerce retailer in America, Amazon has an  international presence over various categories and faces an intense competition. Based on the  similarity in the breadth of products, geographic market coverage, and scope of business, three  major competitors are identified: eBay, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart, as the world’s largest retail chain, utilizes a cost leadership strategy with low  cost management in value chain to market its products at the lowest price through both e- commerce and physical stores.  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 5  information online. The fact that Amazon is able to reduce their overhead costs by not having  retail locations allows them to achieve these low prices, enabling them to compete in the industry.  Threat of Substitute Products  The threat of substitutes for Amazon is high. The only unique characteristic Amazon has  is the patented technology (such as 1-Click Ordering), which differentiates them from other  possible substitutes. However, there are many alternatives providing the same products and  services, which could reduce Amazon’s competitive advantage.

to compete against Amazon through utilizing  competitive pricing, cost leadership, and differentiation strategies.  3 Assumptions: Competitors believe that the demand for online shopping will continue to  grow as consumers seek for more convenient and efficient ways of shopping.  4 Capabilities: Competitors offer similar products as Amazon either at a lower price or  accompanied with differentiated services.  Some of them have an international presence  with stable financial performance, enabling them to form global strategic alliances to  increase their market base of customers.    Current Situations & Challenges   Amazon uses huge amount of data storage to improve customer service. However,  Amazon’s Elastic Block Storage (EBS) service has been down several times in 2012 due to an  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 6  eBay, operating as the biggest online auction house and focusing as a service provider,  employs cost leadership strategy by solely operating e-commerce as an intermediary without  holding any inventories or physical infrastructures. It also applies a differentiation strategy by  providing a variety of products, high-quality service security, and E-commerce services.  Barnes and Noble, America’s largest book retailer operating both online and physical  retail businesses, competes intensively with Amazon for the market share in the book industry. It  pursues an integrated focused cost leadership/differentiation strategy to target price-sensitive  consumers by providing books not readily or commonly available at a less expensive price.    The competitors’ analysis can be summarized as below:  1 Future objectives: Competitors want to compete for a good strategic position and become  the market leader in both e-commerce and physical commerce.  2 Current strategy: Competitors aim to increase profitability,\n----\n\t\r \xa0 1  Company Background  When Amazon was founded in 1993 by creator Jeff Benzos, it was mostly an online bookstore.  Initially Amazon’s growth was very slow, not turning a profit until over 7 years after its founding. This  was thanks to the great momentum provided by the dot-com bubble. As time went on, Amazon became  widely known as the place to shop for books, and the self proclaimed: “world’s largest bookstore”. As  time progressed, so did Amazon’s business strategy. Amazon transformed their corporate-level strategy  into a mergers and acquisitions approach and did this with great success.  Amazon’s goal today is to be a place a customer can go to purchase anything online. Amazon has  transformed from a garage-based bookstore into a $48 billion dollar retail machine. They have been able  to do this thanks to the power of technological progress. Computational power, bandwidth and data \n----\n influence customers decisions when searching for the best online  retailer. There is also an increasing number of dot-com retailers due to the relatively low start-up  costs of the business.     Competitor Analysis  As the fastest-growing, multinational e-commerce retailer in America, Amazon has an  international presence over various categories and faces an intense competition. Based on the  similarity in the breadth of products, geographic market coverage, and scope of business, three  major competitors are identified: eBay, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart, as the world’s largest retail chain, utilizes a cost leadership strategy with low  cost management in value chain to market its products at the lowest price through both e- commerce and physical stores.  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 5  information online. The fact that Amazon is able to reduce their overhead costs by not having  retail locations allows them to achieve these low prices, enabling them to compete in the industry.  Threat of Substitute Products  The threat of substitutes for Amazon is high. The only unique characteristic Amazon has  is the patented technology (such as 1-Click Ordering), which differentiates them from other  possible substitutes. However, there are many alternatives providing the same products and  services, which could reduce Amazon’s competitive advantage. Therefore, Amazon does not  have absolute competitive advantage on their product offerings, but they definitely have the  advantage when it comes to the quality of customer service and convenience provided.   Rivalry Among Competing Firms  Rivalry among competing firms is high. There are a vast number of search engines on the  Internet which are able to influence customers decisions when searching for the best online  retailer. There is also an increasing number of dot\n----\n\t\r \xa0 2  been occurring is that many consumers are changing their spending habits toward finding  “bargain goods”. Amazon has been able to benefit from this greatly thanks to their ability to  offer affordable goods quickly and easily to the general public.  Sociocultural  Online shopping has grown dramatically in popularity over recent years. E-commerce is  convenient since there are no geographic restrictions and consumers can have access to a  selection of goods wherever and whenever they want. Moreover, there is an unlimited selection of  merchandise for customers to review and compare. These advantages shift customers’ shopping  behavior from retail stores to online shopping. According to a survey of online shoppers: 48  percent of respondents shopped online in the past 12 months, 66 percent preferred web retailers,  and 73 percent completed nearly half of their shopping online. The increasing popularity of  online shopping is providing a foundation for Amazon to exploit their core competencies.   Global  With the advances in\n----\n\t\r \xa0 4  should also exploit opportunities from emerging countries, such as China and India, which have  large populations and growing disposable income. Based on a global survey of online shoppers,  people in China engaged in online shopping 8.4 times more than those in any other markets on a  monthly basis. Thanks to the network of distribution services and the power of E-Commerce,  Amazon is in a position to utilize its core competencies in order to capture the global market.    Industry Analysis  Threat of New Entrants    The threat of new entrants is considered to be low. It is easy for companies to start-up in  this industry due to the relatively low capital investment costs. However, to achieve the position  in the industry that Amazon holds it would require huge investment in infrastructure and  inventory. It is also hard for new entrants to gain customer loyalty since the existing major  competitors, such as Amazon, have established a loyal customer base.  \n----\n tanked, many people chose to migrate their shopping onto an online platform. In 2011,  online sales actually increased by 11 percent despite what people imagined. The reason this has  \n----\n providing a foundation for Amazon to exploit their core competencies.   Global  With the advances in modern tech support and web security, people are getting more and  more willing to make purchases online. As the economies of emerging markets are rising  dramatically, people in those countries with increasing purchasing power are spending more on  online shopping. Services such as Amazon are able to exploit this opportunity by offering  consumers goods which are not readily available in local markets. While firms expand  internationally, it is critical to take into account of the differences in consumer preferences.  Technological  The Internet is an excellent source of data that provides the most timely available  information that captures the shift in consumer preferences and trends. As technology has been  rapidly advancing, businesses have been influenced by technological innovations. For example,  \n----\n content and  distribution centers, it is difficult to predict when the benefits from these investments will be realized.  Amazon has stopped growing for a while and their margin has been constant for several years. The  company needs a margin expansion in order to prevent the company’s share price from dropping.    Future Outlook  Overall, there are remarkable challenges for Amazon to yet overcome. If they are able to  swiftly react they will be able to maintain their competitive advantages through harnessing their  core competencies. Continued success in the emerging markets will ensure that Amazon has a  bright and better tomorrow.          \n----\nEntities:\n:Cost Leadership\n:Differentiation\n:Global_Market\n:Integrated Focused Cost Leadership/Differentiation\n:Online_Sales_Taxes\n:Smartphone_App\nActivity:Online Shopping\nAmount:$48 Billion\nCompany:Amazon.Com (Founded in 1993 by Jeff Benzos, initially an online bookstore, now a $48 billion retail machine selling products in over forty categories.)\nCountry:Afghanistan\nCountry:China (Emerging country with large population and growing disposable income.)\nCountry:India (Emerging country with large population and growing disposable income.)\nCourse:Bus 478 (Seminar on Business Strategy)\nDate:1993\nEvent:Dot-Com Bubble\nLocation:Distribution Centers\nLocation:U.S. East Data Center\nOrganization:Amazon (Fastest-growing, multinational e-commerce retailer in America with international presence.)\nOrganization:Barnes And Noble (Major competitor of Amazon based on product breadth, geographic market coverage, and scope of business.)\nOrganization:Ebay (Major competitor of Amazon based on product breadth, geographic market coverage, and scope of business.)\nOrganization:Florida Panthers (Reigning league champions, winning the 2024 Stanley Cup Finals.)\nOrganization:Wal-Mart (World’s largest retail chain utilizing a cost leadership strategy with low cost management in value chain.)\nPerson:Jae Kim\nPerson:Jeff Benzos (Founder of Amazon.com)\nPerson:Jessica Zhang\nPerson:Jin Can Chen\nPerson:John Chen\nPerson:Mir Osman Ali Khan (The seventh Nizam who signed an instrument of accession, joining India.)\nPerson:Nizam (Ruler of Hyderabad State from 1724 to 1948, initially a viceroy of the Mughal empire in the Deccan.)\nPerson:Rinku Singh\nPerson:Rohit Sharma\nPerson:Sanju Samson\nPerson:Shivam Dube\nPerson:Tristan Landrecht\nPerson:Virat Kohli\nPerson:Yashasvi Jaiswal\nProduct:Kindle\nProduct:Video Content\nTechnology:1-Click Ordering\nTechnology:Cloud\nTechnology:Elastic Block Storage (Ebs)\nTechnology:Internet\n----\nRelationships:\nCompany:Amazon.Com FOUNDED Date:1993\nCompany:Amazon.Com FOUNDER Person:Jeff Benzos\nCompany:Amazon.Com GROWTH_MOMENTUM Event:Dot-Com Bubble\nCompany:Amazon.Com VALUATION Amount:$48 Billion\nCountry:India MATCH Country:Afghanistan\nCourse:Bus 478 GROUP_MEMBER Person:Jae Kim\nCourse:Bus 478 GROUP_MEMBER Person:Jessica Zhang\nCourse:Bus 478 GROUP_MEMBER Person:Jin Can Chen\nCourse:Bus 478 GROUP_MEMBER Person:John Chen\nCourse:Bus 478 GROUP_MEMBER Person:Tristan Landrecht\nCourse:Bus 478 PROJECT Company:Amazon.Com\nOrganization:Amazon CAPTURES :Global_Market\nOrganization:Amazon COMPETES_WITH Organization:Barnes And Noble\nOrganization:Amazon COMPETES_WITH Organization:Ebay\nOrganization:Amazon COMPETES_WITH Organization:Wal-Mart\nOrganization:Amazon COMPETITOR Organization:Barnes And Noble\nOrganization:Amazon COMPETITOR Organization:Ebay\nOrganization:Amazon COMPETITOR Organization:Wal-Mart\nOrganization:Amazon DISCLOSES :Online_Sales_Taxes\nOrganization:Amazon INVESTS_IN Location:Distribution Centers\nOrganization:Amazon INVESTS_IN Product:Kindle\nOrganization:Amazon INVESTS_IN Product:Video Content\nOrganization:Amazon INVESTS_IN Technology:Cloud\nOrganization:Amazon LOCATED_AT Location:U.S. East Data Center\nOrganization:Amazon OPPORTUNITY Country:China\nOrganization:Amazon RELEASED :Smartphone_App\nOrganization:Amazon USES Technology:1-Click Ordering\nOrganization:Amazon USES Technology:Elastic Block Storage (Ebs)\nOrganization:Barnes And Noble COMPETES_WITH Organization:Amazon\nOrganization:Barnes And Noble USES :Integrated Focused Cost Leadership/Differentiation\nOrganization:Ebay COMPETES_WITH Organization:Amazon\nOrganization:Ebay USES :Cost Leadership\nOrganization:Ebay USES :Differentiation\nOrganization:Florida Panthers ESTABLISHED Date:1993\nOrganization:Wal-Mart USES :Cost Leadership\nPerson:Jae Kim MEMBER Course:Bus 478\nPerson:Jessica Zhang MEMBER Course:Bus 478\nPerson:Jin Can Chen MEMBER Course:Bus 478\nPerson:John Chen MEMBER Course:Bus 478\nPerson:Mir Osman Ali Khan SIGNED_ACCESSION Country:India\nPerson:Nizam JOINED Country:India\nPerson:Rinku Singh PLAYER Country:India\nPerson:Rohit Sharma PLAYER Country:India\nPerson:Sanju Samson PLAYER Country:India\nPerson:Shivam Dube PLAYER Country:India\nPerson:Tristan Landrecht MEMBER Course:Bus 478\nPerson:Virat Kohli PLAYER Country:India\nPerson:Yashasvi Jaiswal PLAYER Country:India\nTechnology:Internet SUPPORTS Activity:Online Shopping\nDocument end\n']","Amazon's competitors in the book industry use an integrated focused cost leadership/differentiation strategy to attract price-sensitive customers.

Initially Amazon’s growth was very slow, not turning a profit until over 7 years after its founding. This  was thanks to the great momentum provided by the dot-com bubble. As time went on, Amazon became  widely known as the place to shop for books, and the self proclaimed: “world’s largest bookstore”. As  time progressed, so did Amazon’s business strategy. Amazon transformed their corporate-level strategy  into a mergers and acquisitions approach and did this with great success.  Amazon’s goal today is to be a place a customer can go to purchase anything online. Amazon has  transformed from a garage-based bookstore into a $48 billion dollar retail machine.

Barnes and Noble, America’s largest book retailer operating both online and physical  retail businesses, competes intensively with Amazon for the market share in the book industry.

Future Outlook  Overall, there are remarkable challenges for Amazon to yet overcome.

Initially Amazon’s growth was very slow, not turning a profit until over 7 years after its founding. This  was thanks to the great momentum provided by the dot-com bubble. As time went on, Amazon became  widely known as the place to shop for books, and the self proclaimed: “world’s largest bookstore”. As  time progressed, so did Amazon’s business strategy. Amazon transformed their corporate-level strategy  into a mergers and acquisitions approach and did this with great success.  Amazon’s goal today is to be a place a customer can go to purchase anything online. Amazon has  transformed from a garage-based bookstore into a $48 billion dollar retail machine. They have been able  to do this thanks to the power of technological progress. Computational power, bandwidth and data \n----\n\t\r \xa0 6  eBay, operating as the biggest online auction house and focusing as a service provider,  employs cost leadership strategy by solely operating e-commerce as an intermediary without  holding any inventories or physical infrastructures. It also applies a differentiation strategy by  providing a variety of products, high-quality service security, and E-commerce services.  Barnes and Noble, America’s largest book retailer operating both online and physical  retail businesses, competes intensively with Amazon for the market share in the book industry. It  pursues an integrated focused cost leadership/differentiation strategy to target price-sensitive  consumers by providing books not readily or commonly available at a less expensive price.

Amazon has stopped growing for a while and their margin has been constant for several years. The  company needs a margin expansion in order to prevent the company’s share price from dropping.    Future Outlook  Overall, there are remarkable challenges for Amazon to yet overcome. If they are able to  swiftly react they will be able to maintain their competitive advantages through harnessing their  core competencies. Continued success in the emerging markets will ensure that Amazon has a  bright and better tomorrow.          \n----\n\t\r \xa0 5  information online. The fact that Amazon is able to reduce their overhead costs by not having  retail locations allows them to achieve these low prices, enabling them to compete in the industry.  Threat of Substitute Products  The threat of substitutes for Amazon is high. The only unique characteristic Amazon has  is the patented technology (such as 1-Click Ordering), which differentiates them from other  possible substitutes. However, there are many alternatives providing the same products and  services, which could reduce Amazon’s competitive advantage. Therefore, Amazon does not  have absolute competitive advantage on their product offerings, but they definitely have the  advantage when it comes to the quality of customer service and convenience provided.

There is also an increasing number of dot-com retailers due to the relatively low start-up  costs of the business.     Competitor Analysis  As the fastest-growing, multinational e-commerce retailer in America, Amazon has an  international presence over various categories and faces an intense competition. Based on the  similarity in the breadth of products, geographic market coverage, and scope of business, three  major competitors are identified: eBay, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart, as the world’s largest retail chain, utilizes a cost leadership strategy with low  cost management in value chain to market its products at the lowest price through both e- commerce and physical stores.  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 4  should also exploit opportunities from emerging countries, such as China and India, which have  large populations and growing disposable income. Based on a global survey of online shoppers,  people in China engaged in online shopping 8.4 times more than those in any other markets on a  monthly basis. Thanks to the network of distribution services and the power of E-Commerce,  Amazon is in a position to utilize its core competencies in order to capture the global market.    Industry Analysis  Threat of New Entrants    The threat of new entrants is considered to be low. It is easy for companies to start-up in  this industry due to the relatively low capital investment costs. However, to achieve the position  in the industry that Amazon holds it would require huge investment in infrastructure and  inventory. It is also hard for new entrants to gain customer loyalty since the existing major  competitors, such as Amazon, have established a loyal customer base.  \n----\n both e-commerce and physical commerce.  2 Current strategy: Competitors aim to increase profitability, gain market share, and  provide a wide variety of products to compete against Amazon through utilizing  competitive pricing, cost leadership, and differentiation strategies.  3 Assumptions: Competitors believe that the demand for online shopping will continue to  grow as consumers seek for more convenient and efficient ways of shopping.  4 Capabilities: Competitors offer similar products as Amazon either at a lower price or  accompanied with differentiated services.  Some of them have an international presence  with stable financial performance, enabling them to form global strategic alliances to  increase their market base of customers.

Today Amazon is a logistics platform, a search engine, an Internet  advertising platform, as well as fulfilling roles as an e-commerce and IT platform. The key areas of focus  for Amazon are low prices, convenience, selection, and availability.    External Analysis  General Environment  Economic  Since the start of 2008, the global economy has been in a recession. The World Bank  reduced each country’s expected GDP growth for the year of 2013. The low GDP growth and  high unemployment rate have reduced people’s wealth and purchasing power of goods. When  the market tanked, many people chose to migrate their shopping onto an online platform. In 2011,  online\n----\n providing a foundation for Amazon to exploit their core competencies.   Global  With the advances in modern tech support and web security, people are getting more and  more willing to make purchases online. As the economies of emerging markets are rising  dramatically, people in those countries with increasing purchasing power are spending more on  online shopping. Services such as Amazon are able to exploit this opportunity by offering  consumers goods which are not readily available in local markets. While firms expand  internationally, it is critical to take into account of the differences in consumer preferences.  Technological  The Internet is an excellent source of data that provides the most timely available  information that captures the shift in consumer preferences and trends. As technology has been  rapidly advancing, businesses have been influenced by technological innovations. For example,  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 7  electric outage. The main problem comes from the Amazon’s U.S. East data center in Virginia,  which is the biggest and the oldest data center that has been causing outage issues. The company  needs to do major upgrades on the U.S. East data center to prevent the services from going down  in the future. Otherwise, the server crashes can bring inconvenience and discomfort to the  customers who use the website regularly.  Some of Amazon’s services such as Kindle and Cloud have been increasing expenditures  throughout the company. Amazon is planning to reduce investments in the Kindle and Cloud  initiatives next year. In order to remain competitive in the industry, Amazon should keep  investing in new projects that generate more revenue to reflect the value of the company.

Initially Amazon’s growth was very slow, not turning a profit until over 7 years after its founding. This  was thanks to the great momentum provided by the dot-com bubble. As time went on, Amazon became  widely known as the place to shop for books, and the self proclaimed: “world’s largest bookstore”. As  time progressed, so did Amazon’s business strategy. Amazon transformed their corporate-level strategy  into a mergers and acquisitions approach and did this with great success.  Amazon’s goal today is to be a place a customer can go to purchase anything online. Amazon has  transformed from a garage-based bookstore into a $48 billion dollar retail machine. They have been able  to do this thanks to the power of technological progress. Computational power, bandwidth and data \n----\n\t\r \xa0 6  eBay, operating as the biggest online auction house and focusing as a service provider,  employs cost leadership strategy by solely operating e-commerce as an intermediary without  holding any inventories or physical infrastructures. It also applies a differentiation strategy by  providing a variety of products, high-quality service security, and E-commerce services.  Barnes and Noble, America’s largest book retailer operating both online and physical  retail businesses, competes intensively with Amazon for the market share in the book industry. It  pursues an integrated focused cost leadership/differentiation strategy to target price-sensitive  consumers by providing books not readily or commonly available at a less expensive price.

Amazon has stopped growing for a while and their margin has been constant for several years. The  company needs a margin expansion in order to prevent the company’s share price from dropping.    Future Outlook  Overall, there are remarkable challenges for Amazon to yet overcome. If they are able to  swiftly react they will be able to maintain their competitive advantages through harnessing their  core competencies. Continued success in the emerging markets will ensure that Amazon has a  bright and better tomorrow.          \n----\n\t\r \xa0 5  information online. The fact that Amazon is able to reduce their overhead costs by not having  retail locations allows them to achieve these low prices, enabling them to compete in the industry.  Threat of Substitute Products  The threat of substitutes for Amazon is high. The only unique characteristic Amazon has  is the patented technology (such as 1-Click Ordering), which differentiates them from other  possible substitutes. However, there are many alternatives providing the same products and  services, which could reduce Amazon’s competitive advantage. Therefore, Amazon does not  have absolute competitive advantage on their product offerings, but they definitely have the  advantage when it comes to the quality of customer service and convenience provided.

There is also an increasing number of dot-com retailers due to the relatively low start-up  costs of the business.     Competitor Analysis  As the fastest-growing, multinational e-commerce retailer in America, Amazon has an  international presence over various categories and faces an intense competition. Based on the  similarity in the breadth of products, geographic market coverage, and scope of business, three  major competitors are identified: eBay, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart, as the world’s largest retail chain, utilizes a cost leadership strategy with low  cost management in value chain to market its products at the lowest price through both e- commerce and physical stores.  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 4  should also exploit opportunities from emerging countries, such as China and India, which have  large populations and growing disposable income. Based on a global survey of online shoppers,  people in China engaged in online shopping 8.4 times more than those in any other markets on a  monthly basis. Thanks to the network of distribution services and the power of E-Commerce,  Amazon is in a position to utilize its core competencies in order to capture the global market.    Industry Analysis  Threat of New Entrants    The threat of new entrants is considered to be low. It is easy for companies to start-up in  this industry due to the relatively low capital investment costs. However, to achieve the position  in the industry that Amazon holds it would require huge investment in infrastructure and  inventory. It is also hard for new entrants to gain customer loyalty since the existing major  competitors, such as Amazon, have established a loyal customer base.  \n----\n both e-commerce and physical commerce.  2 Current strategy: Competitors aim to increase profitability, gain market share, and  provide a wide variety of products to compete against Amazon through utilizing  competitive pricing, cost leadership, and differentiation strategies.  3 Assumptions: Competitors believe that the demand for online shopping will continue to  grow as consumers seek for more convenient and efficient ways of shopping.  4 Capabilities: Competitors offer similar products as Amazon either at a lower price or  accompanied with differentiated services.  Some of them have an international presence  with stable financial performance, enabling them to form global strategic alliances to  increase their market base of customers.    Current Situations & Challenges   Amazon uses huge amount of data storage to improve customer service.

Today Amazon is a logistics platform, a search engine, an Internet  advertising platform, as well as fulfilling roles as an e-commerce and IT platform. The key areas of focus  for Amazon are low prices, convenience, selection, and availability.    External Analysis  General Environment  Economic  Since the start of 2008, the global economy has been in a recession. The World Bank  reduced each country’s expected GDP growth for the year of 2013. The low GDP growth and  high unemployment rate have reduced people’s wealth and purchasing power of goods.

Global  With the advances in modern tech support and web security, people are getting more and  more willing to make purchases online. As the economies of emerging markets are rising  dramatically, people in those countries with increasing purchasing power are spending more on  online shopping. Services such as Amazon are able to exploit this opportunity by offering  consumers goods which are not readily available in local markets. While firms expand  internationally, it is critical to take into account of the differences in consumer preferences.  Technological  The Internet is an excellent source of data that provides the most timely available  information that captures the shift in consumer preferences and trends. As technology has been  rapidly advancing, businesses have been influenced by technological innovations. For example,  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 7  electric outage. The main problem comes from the Amazon’s U.S. East data center in Virginia,  which is the biggest and the oldest data center that has been causing outage issues. The company  needs to do major upgrades on the U.S. East data center to prevent the services from going down  in the future. Otherwise, the server crashes can bring inconvenience and discomfort to the  customers who use the website regularly.  Some of Amazon’s services such as Kindle and Cloud have been increasing expenditures  throughout the company. Amazon is planning to reduce investments in the Kindle and Cloud  initiatives next year. In order to remain competitive in the industry, Amazon should keep  investing in new projects that generate more revenue to reflect the value of the company.

As time went on, Amazon became  widely known as the place to shop for books, and the self proclaimed: “world’s largest bookstore”. As  time progressed, so did Amazon’s business strategy. Amazon transformed their corporate-level strategy  into a mergers and acquisitions approach and did this with great success.  Amazon’s goal today is to be a place a customer can go to purchase anything online. Amazon has  transformed from a garage-based bookstore into a $48 billion dollar retail machine.

Threat of Substitute Products  The threat of substitutes for Amazon is high. The only unique characteristic Amazon has  is the patented technology (such as 1-Click Ordering), which differentiates them from other  possible substitutes. However, there are many alternatives providing the same products and  services, which could reduce Amazon’s competitive advantage.

Bargaining power of  suppliers to Amazon is particularly low since suppliers do not require payment until 35 days  after the confirmation of sales.

E-commerce is  convenient since there are no geographic restrictions and consumers can have access to a  selection of goods wherever and whenever they want.

However,  Amazon’s Elastic Block Storage (EBS) service has been down several times in 2012 due to an  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 7  electric outage. The main problem comes from the Amazon’s U.S. East data center in Virginia,  which is the biggest and the oldest data center that has been causing outage issues. The company  needs to do major upgrades on the U.S. East data center to prevent the services from going down  in the future. Otherwise, the server crashes can bring inconvenience and discomfort to the  customers who use the website regularly.  Some of Amazon’s services such as Kindle and Cloud have been increasing expenditures  throughout the company. Amazon is planning to reduce investments in the Kindle and Cloud  initiatives next year. In order to remain competitive in the industry, Amazon should keep  investing in new projects that generate more revenue to reflect the value of the company.

Industry Analysis  Threat of New Entrants    The threat of new entrants is considered to be low.

Competitor Analysis  As the fastest-growing, multinational e-commerce retailer in America, Amazon has an  international presence over various categories and faces an intense competition. Based on the  similarity in the breadth of products, geographic market coverage, and scope of business, three  major competitors are identified: eBay, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart, as the world’s largest retail chain, utilizes a cost leadership strategy with low  cost management in value chain to market its products at the lowest price through both e- commerce and physical stores.  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 1  Company Background  When Amazon was founded in 1993 by creator Jeff Benzos, it was mostly an online bookstore.

Barnes and Noble, America’s largest book retailer operating both online and physical  retail businesses, competes intensively with Amazon for the market share in the book industry. It  pursues an integrated focused cost leadership/differentiation strategy to target price-sensitive  consumers by providing books not readily or commonly available at a less expensive price.

The main problem comes from the Amazon’s U.S. East data center in Virginia,  which is the biggest and the oldest data center that has been causing outage issues.

Future Outlook  Overall, there are remarkable challenges for Amazon to yet overcome. If they are able to  swiftly react they will be able to maintain their competitive advantages through harnessing their  core competencies.

Competitor Analysis  As the fastest-growing, multinational e-commerce retailer in America, Amazon has an  international presence over various categories and faces an intense competition. Based on the  similarity in the breadth of products, geographic market coverage, and scope of business, three  major competitors are identified: eBay, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart.

Moreover, there is an unlimited selection of  merchandise for customers to review and compare. These advantages shift customers’ shopping  behavior from retail stores to online shopping. According to a survey of online shoppers: 48  percent of respondents shopped online in the past 12 months, 66 percent preferred web retailers,  and 73 percent completed nearly half of their shopping online.

Global  With the advances in modern tech support and web security, people are getting more and  more willing to make purchases online.

Services such as Amazon are able to exploit this opportunity by offering  consumers goods which are not readily available in local markets.

Competitor Analysis  As the fastest-growing, multinational e-commerce retailer in America, Amazon has an  international presence over various categories and faces an intense competition. Based on the  similarity in the breadth of products, geographic market coverage, and scope of business, three  major competitors are identified: eBay, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart, as the world’s largest retail chain, utilizes a cost leadership strategy with low  cost management in value chain to market its products at the lowest price through both e- commerce and physical stores.  \n----\n\t\r \xa0 4  should also exploit opportunities from emerging countries, such as China and India, which have  large populations and growing disposable income. Based on a global survey of online shoppers,  people in China engaged in online shopping 8.4 times more than those in any other markets on a  monthly basis. Thanks to the network of distribution services and the power of E-Commerce,  Amazon is in a position to utilize its core competencies in order to capture the global market.    Industry Analysis  Threat of New Entrants    The threat of new entrants is considered to be low. It is easy for companies to start-up in  this industry due to the relatively low capital investment costs. However, to achieve the position  in the industry that Amazon holds it would require huge investment in infrastructure and  inventory. It is also hard for new entrants to gain customer loyalty since the existing major  competitors, such as Amazon, have established a loyal customer base.  \n----\n  to do this thanks to the power of technological progress. Computational power, bandwidth and data  storage technologies all have improved and have become relatively cheaper over time.  In the present day, Amazon sells products in over forty categories. They have everything from  books to electronics, to groceries. Today Amazon is a logistics platform, a search engine, an Internet  advertising platform, as well as fulfilling roles as an e-commerce and IT platform. The key areas of focus  for Amazon are low prices, convenience, selection, and availability.
