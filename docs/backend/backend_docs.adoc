=== Extration of nodes and relations from content
----
POST /extract :
----

This API is responsible for -

** Reading the content of source provided in the form of langchain Document object from respective langchain loaders 

** Dividing the document into multiple chunks, and make below relations - 
*** PART_OF - relation from Document node to all chunk nodes 
*** FIRST_CHUNK - relation from document node to first chunk node
*** NEXT_CHUNK - relation from a chunk pointing to next chunk of the document.
*** HAS_ENTITY - relation between chunk node and entities extracted from LLM.

** Extracting nodes and relations in the form of GraphDocument from respective LLM.

** Update embedding of chunks and create vector index.

** Update K-Nearest Neighbors graph for similar chunks.


**Implementation :**

** For multiple sources of content - 

*** Local file - User can upload pdf file from their device.

*** s3 bucket - User passes the bucket url and all the pdf files inside folders and subfolders will be listed. 

*** GCS bucket - User passes gcs project id, gcs bucket name and folder name, do google authentication to access all the pdf files under that folder and its subfolders and if folder name is not passed by user, all the pdf files under the bucket and its subfolders will be listed if user have read access of the bucket.

*** Web Sources - 
**** Wikipedia - Wikipedia 1st page content is rendered url passed by user. 

**** Youtube - Youtube video transcript is processed and if no transcript is available then respective error is thrown.

**** Web urls - Text Content from any web url is processed for generating graph.

** Langchain's LLMGraphTransformer library is used to get nodes and relations in the form of GraphDocument from LLMs. User and System prompts, LLM chain, graphDocument schema are defined in the library itself.

** SentenceTransformer embeddingds are used by default, also embeddings are made configurable to use either OpenAIEmbeddings or VertexAIEmbeddings.
