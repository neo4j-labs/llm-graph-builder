= LLM Knowledge Graph Builder Frontend

== Objective

This document provides a comprehensive guide for developers on how we build a React application integrated with Neo4j Aura for graph database functionalities. The application allows users to connect to a Neo4j Aura instance and we show you how to automatically create a graph from the unstructured text. We allow users to upload documents locally and from cloud buckets, YouTube videos, and Wikipedia pages, configure a graph schema, extract the lexical, entity and knowledge graph, visualize the extracted graph, ask questions and see the details that were used to generate the answers.

== Architecture Structure 

* For Knowledge Graph builder App:
      ** React JS – Application logic.
      ** Axios – for network calls and handling responses
      ** Styled Components – To handle CSS in JS – Where we write all CSS ourselves, Or Tailwind CSS – 3rd party CSS classes to speed up development.
      ** LongPooling: Long polling can be conceptualized as the simplest way to maintain a steady connection between a client and a server.It holds the request for a period if it has no response to send it back.It regularly updates clients with new information like updating a status, processed chunks every minute with new data.
      ** SSEs are the best options when the server generates the data in a loop and sends multiple events to the clients and if we need real-time traffic from the server to the client.

== Application

== 1.	Setup and Installation: 
Added Node.js with version v21.1.0 and npm on the development machine. 
Install necessary dependencies by running yarn install, such as axios for making HTTP requests and others to interact with the graph.

== 2.	Connect to the Neo4j Aura instance: 
Created a connection modal by adding details including protocol, URI, database name, username, and password. Added a submit button that triggers an API: ***/connect*** and accepts params like uri, password, username and database to establish a connection to the Neo4j Aura instance. Handled the authentication and error scenarios appropriately, by displaying relevant messages. To check whether the backend connection is up and working we hit the API: ***/health.*** The user can now access both AURA DS and AURA DB instances. 

* If GDS Connection is there icon is scientific molecule >  Graph enhancement model > Post processing jobs > gives user the leverage to check and uncheck the communities checkbox.
* If AURA DB > icon is database icon > Graph enhancement model > Post processing jobs > communities checkbox is disabled.

== 3.	File Source integration: 
Implemented various file source integrations including drag-and-drop, web sources search that includes YouTube video, Wikipedia link, Amazon S3 file access, and Google Cloud Storage (GCS) file access. This allows users to upload PDF files from local storage or directly from the integrated sources. 
The Api’s are as follows:

* ***/source_list:***  to fetch the list of files in the DB

image::images/WithData.jpg[Connected, 600]

* ***/upload:***  to upload files from Local

image::images/UploadLocalFile.jpg[Local File, 600]

* ***/url/scan:***  to scan the link or sources of YouTube, Wikipedia, and Web Sources

image::images/WebSources.jpg[WebSources, 600]
          
* ***/url/scan:***  to scan the files of S3 and GCS.

1) Add the respective Bucket URL, access key and secret key to access S3 files.

image::images/S3BucketScan.jpg[S3 scan, 600]

2) Add the respective Project ID, Bucket name, and folder to access GCS files.

image::images/GCSbucketFiles.jpg[GCS scan, 600]

3) User gets a redirect to the authentication page to authenticate their google account.

image::images/Gcloud_auth.jpg[auth login scan, 600]


== 4.	File Source Extraction: 
* ***/extract*** to fetch the number of nodes and relationships created.
   *** During Extraction the selected files or all files in ‘New’ state go into ‘Processing’ state and then ‘Completed’ state if there are no failures.

image::images/GenerateGraph.jpg[Generate Graph, 600]

1) A file with status Completed has an option to be Reprocess with the following options : 

image::images/CompletedReadyToReprocess.jpg[CompletedReadyToReprocess, 600]

2) A file with status Failed/ Cancelled has an option to be Reprocess with the following options :

image::images/FailedReadyToReprocess.jpg[FailedReadyToReprocess, 600]

== 5.	Graph Generation: 

* ***/graph_query:*** 
     *** Created a component for generating graphs based on the files in the table, to extract nodes and relationships. When the user clicks on the Preview Graph or on the Table View icon the user can see that the graph model holds three options for viewing: Lexical Graph, Entity Graph and Knowledge Graph.  We utilized Neo4j's graph library to visualize the extracted nodes and relationships in the form of a graph query API: ***/graph_query***. There are options for customizing the graph visualization such as layout algorithms [zoom in, zoom out, fit, refresh], node styling, relationship types.

     * **Preview Graph**

     ** This API is used to retrive the neighbor nodes of the given element id of the node.

image::images/NeighbourNodeDisconnected.jpg[Neighbourhood Graph, 600]

== 6.	Chatbot: 
Created a Chatbot Component which has state variables to manage user input and chat messages. Once the user asks the question and clicks on the Ask button API: ***/chatbot*** is triggered to send user input to the backend and receive the response. The chat also has options for users to see more details about the chat, text to speech and copy the response.

  ** Running through docker-compose
  ** By default only OpenAI and Diffbot are enabled since Gemini requires extra GCP configurations.
  ** In your root folder, create a .env file with your OPENAI and DIFFBOT keys (if you want to use both),  
  ** By default, the input sources will be: Local files, Youtube, Wikipedia ,AWS S3 and Webpages. As this default config is applied:
  ** By default,all of the chat modes will be available: vector, graph+vector and graph. If none of the mode is mentioned in the chat modes variable all modes will be available:
  ** You can then run Docker Compose to build and start all components:

* Delete entities and start from begnning - If the file source is already processed and have any existing nodes and relations then those will be deleted and file will be reprocessed from the 1st chunk.
* Start from last processed postion - Cancelled or failed files will be processed from the last successfully processed chunk position. This option is not available for completed files.
